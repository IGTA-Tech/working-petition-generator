---

## 🎯 CRITICAL: PRE-RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS

**BEFORE conducting any Perplexity research, you MUST:**

### 1. **Beneficiary Title Analysis** (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Reference: `BENEFICIARY_TITLE_RESEARCH_GUIDE.md`

Analyze the beneficiary's job title/professional descriptor to determine:
- Evidence scope (EXPANDING/RESTRICTING/SPLITTING)
- Primary O-1/EB-1A criteria that title naturally supports
- Evidence thresholds based on level descriptor (world-class vs professional vs elite)
- Appropriate research strategy (Competitor/Creator/Business/Multi-Domain)

**Example:**
- Title: "Professional MMA fighter" → RESTRICTING scope (MMA only, not boxing)
- Primary criteria: Rankings (Criterion 2), National team (Criterion 2), Media (Criterion 3)
- Strategy: Competitor/Performer research approach

### 2. **Comprehensive Research Methodology**
Reference: `COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY_TRAINING.md`

Apply the complete professional attorney methodology including:
- 4-Tier Source Quality Framework (Tier 1 = Gold, Tier 4 = Avoid)
- Wikipedia mining strategy (extract external links, never cite Wikipedia text)
- National team priority for athletes (satisfies multiple criteria)
- "5-7 pages" evidence collection rule
- Field-specific nuances (combat sports, tennis, cricket, etc.)

**Research Goal:** Find 20-30 additional high-quality sources beyond what the user provides, organized by visa criterion and evidence tier.

## 🔄 DEDUPLICATION & FILTERING STRATEGY

### URL Filtering Process

**Step 1: Remove Exact Duplicates**
- Same URL provided by user = skip

**Step 2: Remove Domain Duplicates (If Excessive)**
- If >5 URLs from same domain, keep only best 5
- Prioritize: longer articles, recent dates, most comprehensive

**Step 3: Remove Low-Value URLs**
- Social media profiles (unless official verified accounts with substantive content)
- Paywalled content (if user can't access)
- Dead links or 404 errors
- Non-English content (unless specifically valuable)

**Step 4: Prioritize by Tier + Criterion**
- Tier 1 sources = highest priority
- Sources proving multiple criteria = higher priority
- Recent + historical balance (show sustained acclaim)

**Final Output Target:**
- 20-30 additional URLs beyond user-provided
- Balanced across Tier 1/2/3
- Covering multiple criteria
- Mix of recent and historical

---

## 📝 SEARCH QUERY GENERATION FRAMEWORK

### How to Build Effective Search Queries

**Basic Formula:**
`"[Exact Name]" + [Field] + [Evidence Type]`

**Advanced Formula:**
`"[Exact Name]" + (site:domain1.com OR site:domain2.com) + [Evidence Type]`

**Boolean Operators:**
- `AND` = must include both terms
- `OR` = include either term
- `NOT` or `-` = exclude term
- `""` = exact phrase match
- `site:` = search specific domain

**Example Query Progression:**

**Level 1 (Broad):**
`"John Smith" + MMA`

**Level 2 (Specific):**
`"John Smith" + MMA + UFC OR Bellator`

**Level 3 (Targeted):**
`"John Smith" + (site:espn.com OR site:sherdog.com OR site:mmafighting.com) + profile OR interview`

**Level 4 (Criterion-Specific):**
`"John Smith" + (site:espn.com OR site:sherdog.com) + award OR performance bonus`

## 🚨 CRITICAL RESEARCH PRINCIPLES

### 1. THE WIKIPEDIA PRINCIPLE
**Wikipedia itself ≠ credible source**
**Wikipedia citations and external links = goldmine**
- Always check Wikipedia
- Ignore article text
- Go straight to "References" and "External Links" sections at bottom
- Extract ALL credible primary sources

### 2. THE ONE ACHIEVEMENT, MULTIPLE CRITERIA PRINCIPLE
**Single major achievement can satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously**
- Example: Olympic participation proves:
  - ✅ Awards (if medal)
  - ✅ Critical role (national team member)
  - ✅ Press coverage (Olympics always covered)
  - ✅ Membership (selective national team)
- **Action:** When you find major achievement, research it exhaustively for all criteria

### 3. THE FIELD-SPECIFIC METRIC PRINCIPLE
**Every field has its own key performance indicators**
- Poker: Best live cash, all-time money list ranking
- Esports: World ranking, tournament placements
- Track & Field: Personal bests, world rankings by event
- Academia: Publications, citations, h-index
- **Action:** Identify the field's KPIs first, then research those specific metrics

### 4. THE REGIONAL DOMINANCE PRINCIPLE
**Regional dominance can establish international recognition**
- Even without global rankings, can prove international recognition via:
  - Regional tournament wins with media coverage
  - National association endorsements
  - Cross-border media coverage (neighboring countries)
  - Expert attestation about international standing
- **Action:** If global rankings weak, pivot to regional research strategy

### 5. THE YOUTH ACHIEVEMENTS PRINCIPLE
**Youth accomplishments carry significant weight**
- Youth national teams (U-17, U-19, U-21)
- Junior championships
- College/university achievements
- Early career breakthrough
- **Action:** Research youth achievements as evidence of sustained excellence trajectory

### 6. THE CONTEXT MATTERS PRINCIPLE
**Industry-specific nuances affect research strategy**
- Example: Esports - switching games = switching sports entirely
- Example: MMA - training partner for champions = critical role
- Example: Theater - Broadway vs Off-Broadway distinction matters
- **Action:** Understand how the specific industry defines "field" and "excellence"

### Key Principles Applied from Comprehensive Methodology

1. **Wikipedia Mining Strategy**
   - Never cite Wikipedia text itself
   - Extract ALL external links and references
   - Follow primary sources from citations

2. **National Team Priority (Athletes)**
   - Satisfies multiple criteria: Awards, Membership, Critical Role, Press
   - Always verify through national federation
   - Include international competition participation

3. **The "5-7 Pages" Rule**
   - Not too few (2-3 = incomplete)
   - Not too many (15-20 = overwhelming/padded)
   - Just right (5-7 = comprehensive but focused)

4. **Source Quality Over Quantity**
   - Better to have 3 Tier 1 sources than 20 Tier 3 sources
   - MMA Junkie (USA Today Sports) > random MMA blog
   - Official rankings (Fight Matrix, Tapology) > unverified claims

5. **Field-Specific Research Nuances**
   - MMA: Rankings + national team focus
   - Tennis: National team selection = game-changer
   - Cricket: Country matters (India/Australia = extremely competitive)
   - Figure Skating: Olympic participation = near-automatic qualifier

### Implementation Notes

**For Developers:**
- Load all three documents into research context
- Execute title analysis before Phase 1
- Apply 4-tier filtering to all discovered sources
- Follow field-specific protocols based on beneficiary's domain
- Capture evidence context (not just individual achievements)

**For AI Research Agent:**
- Reference BENEFICIARY_TITLE_RESEARCH_GUIDE.md to determine query strategy
- Reference COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY_TRAINING.md for source quality assessment
- Follow proven case evaluation patterns from professional attorney methodology
- When in doubt: Tier 1-2 sources, national team verification, 5-7 pages per source

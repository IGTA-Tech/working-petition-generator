# 📊 DOCUMENT 2 REDESIGN - Publication Tier & Weight Reference Guide

## VISION

Transform Document 2 from a general "publication analysis" into a **comprehensive reference guide** that maps publications by tier, shows their weight/value, and provides USCIS-officer-friendly documentation.

---

## NEW DOCUMENT 2 PURPOSE

**What It Is:**
- Professional reference guide for publication credibility
- Tier-based classification system (Tier 1-4)
- Evidence weight calculator
- Documentation strategy per publication

**What It's NOT:**
- Not a case-specific analysis (that's Document 1)
- Not a URL list (that's Document 3)
- Not legal reasoning (that's Document 4)

**Target Audience:** Attorney or petitioner who needs to understand:
1. Which publications are credible for USCIS
2. How much weight each publication carries
3. How to document and present each source type
4. Total evidence value of their media coverage

**Target Length:** 4,000-6,000 words

## EVIDENCE WEIGHTING METHODOLOGY

### How Publication Tiers Work

**Tier 1 (20-25 points):** Major mainstream media with editorial standards
- Examples: ESPN, NY Times, BBC, Fox Sports, Reuters
- Why they matter: USCIS gives highest weight to established national/international outlets
- Documentation: Full article screenshots, publication metrics, editorial standards

**Tier 2 (15-20 points):** Industry trade publications and official sources
- Examples: UFC.com, Sherdog, MMA Fighting, industry magazines
- Why they matter: Field-specific expertise and credibility
- Documentation: Industry authority evidence, readership data, specialization proof

**Tier 3 (10-15 points):** Regional media and specialized outlets
- Examples: Bloody Elbow, international outlets, regional newspapers
- Why they matter: Shows broader recognition beyond Tier 1/2
- Documentation: Publication background, audience size, editorial process

**Tier 4 (5-10 points):** Minor outlets, Wikipedia, local sources
- Examples: Wikipedia, local papers, blogs, social media
- Why they matter: Supporting evidence, shows breadth
- Special considerations: Wikipedia needs notability analysis

### Evidence Weight Calculation

**Total Points = Σ (Publications × Tier Weight)**

**Score Interpretation:**
- 150+ points: Exceptional media presence (likely strong approval)
- 100-149 points: Strong media presence (good approval odds)
- 50-99 points: Moderate media presence (borderline - need quality)
- <50 points: Weak media presence (needs significant strengthening)

- **Citation Mining:** External links and references section contains credible sources
- **Career Timeline:** Provides overview (but verify elsewhere)
- **Secondary Support:** Shows widespread recognition (but don't lead with it)

**Wikipedia Strategy for Visa Petitions:**

**✅ DO:**
- Note that beneficiary HAS a Wikipedia page (shows notability)
- Extract external link URLs (these ARE credible sources)
- Mine the references section for Tier 1/2 sources
- Use it to find additional research leads
- Mention it as "supporting evidence of recognition"

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use as primary evidence for "published material" criterion
- Screenshot Wikipedia text as main documentation
- Rely on it for factual claims (verify elsewhere)
- Count it as "major media"

**Evidence Weight:** 5 points (notability indicator only)

**Documentation Strategy:**
- ✅ Note: "Beneficiary has Wikipedia page (shows notability)"
- ✅ Include screenshot showing page exists
- ✅ Extract all external links and cite THOSE as evidence
- ✅ Note page view statistics if exceptionally high
- ❌ Don't use Wikipedia text as published material proof

**USCIS Presentation Format:**
```
Supporting Evidence: Wikipedia Page Existence
Type: Notability Indicator (not primary evidence)
Reach: 1.5B monthly visitors globally
Evidence Weight: 5 points (Tier 4 - Supporting)
Note: Page existence demonstrates public notability.
External links from Wikipedia page have been independently
verified and are presented as separate evidence in this petition.

> "The Beneficiary's achievements have been featured in ESPN, the world's leading sports media outlet with over 150 million monthly visitors and 80 million television households. This constitutes major media recognition as defined by USCIS precedent."

**For Tier 2:**
> "The Beneficiary is profiled on Sherdog, the definitive database for mixed martial arts with 500,000+ fighter profiles. Sherdog is universally cited by mainstream sports media, including ESPN, as the authoritative source for MMA records and statistics."

**For Multiple Sources:**
> "The Beneficiary has been featured across multiple media tiers, demonstrating both mainstream recognition (ESPN, Fox Sports) and deep industry acknowledgment (UFC.com, Sherdog, MMA Fighting). The combined audience reach exceeds 200 million monthly visitors."

---

## EVIDENCE GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS

[Based on publications found:]

**If NO Tier 1 Coverage:**
- **Impact:** Weakens "major media" criterion significantly
- **Action:** Priority research for mainstream media mentions
- **Search Strategy:**
  - "[Name] + site:espn.com OR site:si.com OR site:foxsports.com"
  - "[Name] + [major achievement] + major news outlet"
  - Look for event coverage where beneficiary participated

**If LIMITED Tier 2 Coverage:**
- **Impact:** Weakens industry recognition evidence
- **Action:** Search industry-specific outlets
- **Search Strategy:**
  - For MMA: Sherdog, MMA Fighting, Bloody Elbow, Tapology
  - For field: Identify 3-5 leading trade publications

**If ONLY Recent Coverage:**
- **Impact:** May suggest temporary rather than sustained recognition
- **Action:** Search for historical coverage
- **Search Strategy:**
  - Add date ranges to searches (2020-2021, 2018-2019, etc.)
  - Look for career milestones that would have generated coverage

---

## APPENDIX: PUBLICATION ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

### How USCIS Evaluates Publications

**From Matter of Chawathe (1989):**
- "Major media" must have significant circulation/reach
- Editorial oversight distinguishes from user-generated content
- National or international scope preferred
- Specialized trade journals acceptable if recognized in field

**From Policy Manual:**
- "Major media" includes newspapers, periodicals, professional publications
- Must be about the beneficiary, not just mentioning them
- Material must relate to beneficiary's achievements in the field

**Best Practices:**
- Lead with Tier 1/2 sources in petitions
- Use Tier 3/4 as supporting evidence only
- Calculate and present total reach metrics
- Show geographic diversity
- Demonstrate sustained coverage over time

**TIMING:** Generate AFTER URL research phase completes

**Why:** So it can include:
- Any Tier 1 publications discovered via Perplexity research
- Accurate count of publications per tier
- Real calculated media value score
- Actual publications found (not hypothetical)

### Dynamic Elements to Include:

1. **Publication Count:** Actual count of each tier from research
2. **Media Value Score:** Real calculation based on found publications
3. **Tier 1 Flag:** If ANY Tier 1 found, add 🔥 HIGH VALUE notice
4. **Cumulative Reach:** Sum of all monthly visitors
5. **Publications Profile:** Only profile publications actually found

### Code Integration:

```typescript
// In document-generator.ts

async function generatePublicationAnalysis(
  beneficiaryInfo: BeneficiaryInfo,
  knowledgeBase: string,
  urls: FetchedUrlData[],
  comprehensiveAnalysis: string
): Promise<string> {

  // First, categorize all URLs by tier
  const tier1Pubs = urls.filter(url => isTier1Publication(url.domain));
  const tier2Pubs = urls.filter(url => isTier2Publication(url.domain));
  const tier3Pubs = urls.filter(url => isTier3Publication(url.domain));
  const tier4Pubs = urls.filter(url => isTier4Publication(url.domain));

  // Calculate media value score
  const mediaScore = (tier1Pubs.length * 25) +
                     (tier2Pubs.length * 18) +
                     (tier3Pubs.length * 12) +
                     (tier4Pubs.length * 7);

  // Calculate cumulative reach
  const totalReach = urls.reduce((sum, url) =>
    sum + getPublicationReach(url.domain), 0);

  const prompt = `Generate a Publication Tier & Weight Reference Guide...

  DISCOVERED PUBLICATIONS:
  Tier 1 (Count: ${tier1Pubs.length}): ${tier1Pubs.map(p => p.domain).join(', ')}
  Tier 2 (Count: ${tier2Pubs.length}): ${tier2Pubs.map(p => p.domain).join(', ')}
  Tier 3 (Count: ${tier3Pubs.length}): ${tier3Pubs.map(p => p.domain).join(', ')}
  Tier 4 (Count: ${tier4Pubs.length}): ${tier4Pubs.map(p => p.domain).join(', ')}

  CALCULATED METRICS:
  Media Value Score: ${mediaScore}/100
  Total Cumulative Reach: ${totalReach.toLocaleString()} monthly visitors
  ${tier1Pubs.length > 0 ? '🔥 HIGH VALUE: Tier 1 coverage found!' : ''}

  ...`;

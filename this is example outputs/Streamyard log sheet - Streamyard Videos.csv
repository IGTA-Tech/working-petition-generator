All right, let's get straight into it. I'll bring this to my screen and I'm going to be using Innovative Global Talent Agency's website as how we do this. OK, so the first thing is I'm in a blog, right? But I'm going to make this blog off for SEO. Right. So now it's its own page, but we're not adding the pages. So like the blog itself is searchable, but the pages are not. I just want to see what anybody advanced. Okay. We're not going to do that. All right. So let's make the blog books. All right. So I have the blog post ready over here. I wrote it with my own special chat bot. We're going to put it in Google Docs before we put it in because that helps avoid formatting issues. All right. So headings are very important. Put this as the title heading. I'm going to put that in there. Let's make it a little bit easier for us. Does this one have a place to put the image? So we'll probably put the image right there. We'll work on the text first. So let's go ahead. Actually, before that, O-N visas. So that's heading three. All right. All right. So that's heading three. I'm not going to put those in. That's fine. It's heading four. It's great. It should be heading three. I'm going to make this heading two. All right. That's the title. So we're going to put this in over here and make sure that the spacing looks good. Sometimes I get a little so weird, a little weird. Beautiful. See the headings went in too. And here we're going to put our image. The downloads already put something in. Oh, no. It is missing. Oh, I forgot to download it. That's why. The image already above is already in PNG. Okay. So what it's saying is to make it this. So what you name the files when you do pictures matter. So let's save it. I'm going to do PNG. Oh. File wasn't available on site. Okay, so give me the picture and PNG again. Sometimes AI gets on my nerves. We love it anyway. That's not. I have a problem. Let me pause this so I can see. OK, we're back. Now we're going to optimize the image we made into a sometimes you can just make it into a PNG that way. So we already downloaded it. So now let's start optimizing going through these ones. We need to give it a file name. That we like. So over here, let's go to Downloads. There's a PNG. I don't want to edit like that. There we go. So now we've renamed it. Now look, it's a pretty big file, so we're probably going to need to compress it so it doesn't slow down our website. So let's go to tiny PMG. Let's drop the new file name over here. Now they downloaded it and made it fifty five percent smaller. The next thing. This gets fast load time. For online services to embed keywords. All right, so let's see where we can use to embed keywords. Let's add metadata. See if this works. Looks like it won't let us do it with a PNG. Only one for TRF. For PNG, sorry, for PNG file. Did we already do this one? No, we did that one down there. See if this opens, doing files per day. Cool. Let's use this one. Not editable. So we can't edit this one. Would that have been cool? Let's see. Let's see. Let's see if this one lets us do it. speak or photoshop all right so let's ask it give us the best meta to input and the best Way to do it in pig area free version. So basically I'm asking it what should we put in there and how do we do it in? How do you see today? It go further down. To. Upload the PNG. Open the image and look for the metadata panel on the right side. So I think, I hope that's this. Find the title field, description, and tags. Oh, it's not going to list anything. Oh, so that's another tool to look at to see how to add that in there. Maybe there's a way to. Can you reissue the PNG file? Already in the PNG and web. page whatever do again hmm Now we're getting back into posting for the page. So now I post it as a blog post, and now I'm getting ready to put it as a new page. Standalone. URL slug. And graph tags. Say, what is the URL slug for this? We got that part, didn't we? All right. So we'll go put that here. Make sure it's SEO. All right. Navigation. That's fine. Social image. This is where you also put this. A lot of times people forget that part. All right, okay, so. Of this meta. supposed to be added in the code injection of this page or enter as custom code on the page for effectiveness. All right. So let's go back to it. Oops, I'm on the wrong one. It's supposed to be right here with that. All right. So now we're back up here. We have the title, meta description. So we're going back to SEO. So we add a description. We add the title. We're going to put that H. T, I mean. OK. Make sure not to hide it from the search results. I can go to Save. one thing is we have to get the content again that's fine so we can go back to blog our news and updates as it's called now look at that see I forgot to put the image there under settings Oops, I went away too early. So let's make sure it goes all the way. Now for the blog, I'm not very concerned with the SEO stuff because I turned off the crawling for it. It's going to be a standalone page. We still can put a social image just in case somebody shares it. Okay. So I'm just grabbing the content so I can go put it back in our other page. That's the standalone. Website pages not linked. There we go. Let's go ahead and edit this. Add a section. I'm just looking through to see if I like any of these. We'll use this page. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to put this here. Now let's start putting it back in. Notice that the headings are all what we need it to be. So that will keep our SEO steady. This one we're going to replace. This image again. Let me get that from... All right. Bam. So I'll put that there. Sounds good to go. I'm going to sign up. Put a link. Let's have them contact us or open a new tab. Actually, we will have that open a new tab. So that way they can actually read the content. All right. Next, we're going to add the rest of the text. That's not what we want to do. Add a block. There we go. So we can move this block over here. So we're over here and let's make it wider. Wider. Put it down a little bit. And then we can copy and paste. from here on out. Can I make this centered? I should probably turn this to hair graph too. like this this it just kind of reads better all right so we got that now we need to see if there's remember I asked did any of it um these tags are essential for social media sharing and should be placed in the head page using the code injection feature. So you copy the code. Right, so the code injection's right here. So we're gonna save. Exit. Now we're back in here, so advance. So your website is innovative. OK, so you had to make sure like you check the code. All right. I see how do we put this in already? Yeah, we already put in the SEO. So now it's published. And that's how it's good to go. Now, the thing is to go to Analytics. This is very important. Grab that slug. Go to Google. Go to Analytics. It's at five thirty-one already. I hope it's not on the right property. What is this one called? Innovative. I have to go do this somewhere else. I think it's actually somewhere else. Let's see what's over here. Analytics. It's taking its time. No worries. Internship. Just get into the account where it's at. It is not here. So that means hopefully it is somewhere under here. Okay. Let's just look for it. So I know it should be somewhere. It's under there, out there. So there's the Gill Law Firm. Let's see if it's like this or innovative. Right, so we fucked up. I know the problem. I got to use what you do next is go to Google Search Console. That's what I'm looking for. So there we go. Now you go to URL inspection. Global talent. Not indexed, right? So you put the whole thing in there, request indexing. So now when it does that, it's looking to see if the URL can be indexed, and it's going to be immediately available pretty much on Google, as opposed to, you know, it might be waiting there for a long time to get reactivated. So I'm going to pause it. Oh, well, here it goes. It says it's done now. You're always added to priority. All right, so now it's added to the queue. Oh, you're at it. See, this one was successfully on December fourth, so I don't need to do that. But that's in a nutshell how we do posting of content.

May.10.2025,Sherrod Seward reviews O-1 Filing for Jamacain Artist Superstar,Client Correspondence,Sherrod Seward reviews O-1 Filing for Jamacain Artist Superstar.mp4,Sherrod Seward reviews O-1 Filing for Jamacain Artist Superstar.mp4,Sherrod Seward reviews O-1 Filing for Jamacain Artist Superstar.mp3,"hey how's it going this is attorney sherrod seward and right now I'm getting ready to review uh finalize a o-one-a petition for one of the I guess best selling reggae artists in the world right now uh we've previously went over this and I requested some changes so I'm going to use our checker tool to go ahead and um make sure this is good to go uh so let's see where's that I got to find where I put it. Oh, there we go. Sorry about that. All right. So let's get into it first. We got to say the structure of this. This person has an O-one, but there is a change in employer. They are currently in the United States. Please check the forms. So then the first thing we do is always just check the forms. All right. Oh, sorry, it's an O-one-B, because they're an art, it's not an O-one-A. Yep, so. All right. Itinerary, that's fine. So, that's fine because IGTA is not the petitioner, it's someone else. Technology certification. Verify contract, okay. Now, let's look into the petition itself. what is the structure is this direct employment or agent based um all right please tell me what the contract says and what box is checked in the support letter or cover letter for the petition structure. This one should be direct employment, I believe. They're going to do it as direct employer. Because in this situation, the promoter is collecting all the money from the shows and then paying the artists. So direct employer is fixed. That's great. Yes, this is good. Okay. Now, please look into the eligibility arguments and confirm how many categories are satisfied. Okay. So he has three already. Got it. So that'll work. We're satisfied with how this is going. I'm going to send it to the attorney that put us on the case. We're thankful for the opportunity. Have",,x,x,,
May.09.2025,O-1B Petition Review - World Class Artist from Jamaica,Immigration Sports,O-1B Petition Review - World Class Artist from Jamaica,O-1B Petition Review - World Class Artist from Jamaica.mp4,O-1B Petition Review - World Class Artist from Jamaica.mp3,"We solve problems for the best athletes, coaches and organizations in the world. How's it going? This is attorney Sherrod Seward. And in this video, I'm going to be reviewing a one B petition that we did for another attorney for a world class artist from the great country of Jamaica. Um, when the attorney brought me in, he's like, you know, this is, and honestly I have to say no. Um, but the process is still the same. And so we're very confident in our abilities and we're just really, really, um, thankful, uh, for the, all the attorneys out there that think highly enough of us to trust us with their premier cases. So with that being said, let's get into, into this project and, uh, use our tools to check it out. So right now I'm in the community hub, ompvisas.community. and have our subscription that allows us access to our AI tools. So in this particular one, we're looking at the form checker. We always start there. So I'm going to go launch the tool. You'll need a chat GPT account to be able to use these particular custom GPTs here. And I highly recommend you get it because it's very good at looking at a large amount of data, which often happens in immigration. And so let's go ahead and download the file so we can interact with it and see what's going on. Remember, AI is a tool. It doesn't replace the mind of an attorney. But in some ways, it's just more accurate to see some of the minor things that could go. All right. so when looking at a petition the first thing I always start with is uh the forms and I'll say uh sorry let me get the right keyboard up all right here we go so this individual is on a new petition but previously was approved And they are in the United States. Now, please analyze this petition starting with just the forms. Please check the accuracy of the forms. And one thing we want to do is, I think it's on model four. All right, so let's go. One thing to know about AI, if you're using OpenAI GPT, is that, as of now, the custom GPTs are using model four. You can't really use them with the advanced models like O-three and O-four Mini and stuff like that. But, four point O is a great model. All right. We have here from Core Review. Alright, so. This is incorrect. Got it. Is a change in employee. Alright, so we need to change that because they changed petitioners. So that needs to be in there. Consulate notifications marked with the beneficiaries. Not needed minor issue, but should be left a blank. Yes, part. four should be left blank. Since they are here in the U.S., look to make sure that there is an I- ninety-four with this petition. Wages should be seed attached or mark confidential. That's good. So wages, you just want to leave it blank. You actually, even if you don't want to say the number is, you should still put confidential or see attached if you have some other type of agreement with the petition, which you should have an agreement with it. All right. Let's provide. Okay, so you must provide box for new employment. And say no appropriate organization for a consultation letter. Remind me what the job title is for this petition. Alright, so I wanted to remind me what the job title is. Alright, use these notes to make a message to the drafter of the forms to fix. and separately give me the answers to my inquiry. All right, so now I'm having it make a message to send to about the form. All right, someone pause this while I give this message to them. Okay, we're back. So we made those messages to them. Now we want to look at everything. Recording artist, performer. Okay. Is there I-Ninety-Four information in the package? Uh-oh. Now let's look at the structure. What is the structure of this petition? So now we're asking what is the visa structure? Is it U.S. agent, U.S. agent for foreign employer, U.S. agent for multiple employers, things of that nature. Just look at the cover letter. Let's look at it ourselves, get it open. We like to look at both. Let's scroll down. Okay. Okay, so right now we're doing direct employment. Okay, so we have requests submitted to the advisory, okay. So why would you say there's no advisory or board opinion? All right. So hold on for a second. I've got to tell somebody and, uh, I'll pause it while I can give some more. All right. So I sent a message to the team that this needs to be added to the forms because we did ask for this information from the guild. This serves as a labor asked us for. All right. This is This is all good. I'm not really worried about the itinerary. The next thing I want to get to is contracts and itinerary. Which maybe is at the end of this. So let's wait for it to go. Short time agreement. All right, so I think that works. This works. We can do it as direct employer. We don't have to do it as multiple employer, so that would be fine. Let's go back to the final PDF and see if it's going to give us a preview. Actually, so let's go here. I say, show me the petitioner agreement. Show me. Wait a minute. Okay, so that's good. No IGTA is not mentioned a part of this agreement. Mm-mm-mm. Okay. Is there an itinerary listed with this petition? OK, so that's a problem that there's no itinerary listed with this petition when I know there is one. OK, so I went and did some digging. I cannot show you guys the agreement that is there. But what I will say is that we do have quite a bit of compensation that we're going to put in here and undersea attach. And so what will happen is I'll attach that agreement with it. The way it is structured is that the petitioner will be paying them a set fee for this. It won't be like a certain amount of revenue from the concert. They're getting a certain amount for each stop that they have. And it's pretty substantial, which will help with remuneration as well. So what I'm going to do is off camera, I'm going to add fifteen here compensation and put the number that's in that engagement agreement. and then add that engagement agreement to the petition to go ahead and finalize this up. And from there, we're looking pretty good. So let me pause it and then I'll get right back to you. All right, so we're back and I'm going to add some files to this to help with the instructions. So we've got a petitioner agreement and the engagement. All right. OK, consider. these added to the file. I want you to give instructions to the drafter to do the following. One, add this version of the petitioner agreement. Two, add this itinerary directly behind the petitioner agreement. Make the updates requested in the forms for turn the full file first thing as soon as possible. So we'll get that done. All right, and so with that, that's a thorough review. We'll have these changes made, and this will be a great O-Win package that's ready to go. And I hope that you found this helpful. And while this wasn't sports, we're still going to use the sports outro because I think it's awesome. Peace. Till next time. We solve problems for the best athletes, coaches and organizations in the world.",,x,x,,
May.07.2025,Join Our Knowledge Hub  - Sherrod Sports Visas,Business Development or Marketing,Join Our Knowledge Hub  - Sherrod Sports Visas,Join Our Knowledge Hub  - Sherrod Sports Visas.mp4,Join Our Knowledge Hub  - Sherrod Sports Visas.mp3,"We solve problems for the best athletes, coaches, and organizations in the world. How's it going? This is attorney Sherrod Seward. And today we're doing some live action, a review of a request for evidence. What we're seeing with USCIS is they're scrambling a little bit and it causes them to do different things when it comes to dates. For example, usually And it should be that when you send a premium processing case, which costs upwards of three thousand dollars to submit now, you would expect that the date would be honored when it gets to USCIS office. But now it could take one to two weeks for them to acknowledge the receipt. And then you would think if it took them weeks to acknowledge receipt, they would adhere to their day calendar when it comes to issuing a approval or request for evidence. We're finding now that that's not the case either. And I think what happened now in this RFE is that they issued a request for evidence because they did not get a chance to review the case. And so we're going to respond to that today using our AI tools that we find in our Knowledge Hub and just our common sense and knowledge gained over the years. So that being said, I'm going to share my screen and let's get into this. So here we have an O-two petition based on an athlete. for Suresh Raina, who was involved with the T-TEN Masters Cricket League. And what originally happened is all these beneficiaries were approved for an executive. That's not going to be coming back and forth to the United States. So we're switching it over to the athlete that is going to be coming back and forth to the United States to be with the T-TEN Cricket League. All right. So we're going to go ahead and download that. And then here's a request for evidence. Let's go through it. Real quick. So we can respond by July. I know two cannot work apart. They must be essential for the services nature event. You did not submit evidence for this requirement to have a nature event consultation letters. Each opinion must state they have a working relationship. We did not submit this. This is fine because there's no place to get a consultation letter anyway. Specific requirements. They need to come to United States to assist the performance of an O-one integral to the actual performance and has critical skills and experience. They're not of general nature. Right, so you notice there's some evidence you submit is insufficient. You submitted a statement of each rules respective. However, you have not provided sufficient details about their individual duties and how they're integral. Well, it is a cricket player. Alright, so this is just very general. Oh, you submitted evidence is insufficient. However, you had to prevent evidence that portrait claims as evidence to pass contracts, photos with the old one principle and ever utter evidence that USC can corroborate. So I guess we need a contract skills that don't possess, you know, provide submission, imminent evidence. Okay. So you can see they really just didn't even look at anything in here. And that's fine. There's an easy way to do that is we're going to go ahead and go to our tools here and upload both. So here we have the new petition. Here we have the RFE. Okay. First, let's look at the RFE. We may not upload files larger than that. So let's go to small PDF. and make this smaller. I don't know why this is not compressed already. This is my favorite tool to compress large documents. This doesn't take long either. But as you can see, their RFE was very, very general, generic in nature, which means they probably didn't look at the petition at all. And the other thing is that these persons are approved already for O two visas. So we should probably look up. So we look at Prasham. So we got Prasham lucky approval. So we have his approval notice showing that he is already approved under O one. which can be helpful. Then we look at the other people's names. I forgot. Chirag. So let's look at Chirag. All right, I'll pause it while I look for this real quick because that could be helpful too. Okay, we're back. So we try to do the compression, it's only one percent smaller. That's not a big deal, but what that means is we can't use Cloud AI directly with this document. But we can use it like for this. Please analyze this request. And then over here, we're going to use one of our tools. I'm going to go to the visa school. Say hello. I need you to be the best. So I'm going to have it read the petition. so now I'm going to have it read the entire details and I'm going to say now can you please look at this request for evidence and give me a honest analysis so this particular gpt is trained off of an ebook that we read that we wrote sorry through our Oh, it's a single page approval notice. Sorry, I put the wrong document in there, but I'm just going to go ahead and use it. I'll put the approval notice. And let's go ahead and put this screenshot that we got in there as well. So they can see this one, yeah. save that and store the fact that these persons are all previously approved for GoToVisas with this same entity. Okay, now I will provide more information. This will actually get the right here. Please read in detail the entire O-II petition. These are the beneficiaries we are now concerned about. So that's going to take a little bit of time to upload. But the idea is I'm anticipating that we've already included everything that they're asking for. So we're going to go tell them individual pages going down where those are. Matter of fact, what I may do is get the support letter together. Just that on its own shouldn't be this big of a file. So we'll kind of scroll down past the forms until we get to. the support letter and we'll print that out by itself. So the cover letter starts on twenty six and it goes to basically forty three. And there's a contract forty seven. All right, so we're going to page forty seven, twenty six to forty seven. I'm grabbing that because that generally describes all the evidence that's in there, which is really causing the file to be pretty big. As you see, the chat GPT is still going through this with the O three model. It's not the fastest model, but it's very, very thorough. As you can see, it thinks for thirty seconds here. All right, let's go back and see if this preview is still going. Yeah, this is just a big file. Yeah, but our goal is we're going to, one, say that all these people are previously approved with this petitioner, so they have to have essential skills that are essential to the operations. We'll go and then reiterate that he's not just a cricket player. He's a cricket ambassador under O-one, not P-one. He's doing a lot of things to promote the sport in general. That's Suresh Reina. And then show, like, how these skills are essential to him, and they were all in the same season last year. So that's still going. Do we have a preview? Nope. So what I'll do is I'll just pause the video to not keep it so long until we get those going. Okay, so we're back. And I have just the contract and stuff like that. So this is the twenty-two pages that has the support letter. Please analyze this document compared to the request for evidence. Assume that all of these documents were signed by the respective parties. Do an in-depth analysis. Now over here we have We're going to have CHAT-GBT read the entire petition with the exhibits there. Please now give me the header for responding to this request for evidence. Oh, wait, I need to kill it. All right, so we can go. Oh, wait. Is it still reading? Reading the document, which I like about the O-three is that it will show you what it's thinking as it's going. Looks like we have a little delay here. Probably because the GPT is going. So what I'll do is I'll pause it again until it's ready to go. All right, so we're back. So what I want to do now is start actually writing the response to the request for evidence. Can you please give me the header for the response to this RFE? Write it in Canvas. I think it's called Canvas in here. So if I did it correctly. Now, here we go. We got to the Canvas. Oh, it says July something. All right, so let's start making it. The five, five. Six. Okay. First, let's start off. all of these individuals are previously approved for O-two with the same petitioner. There is no material change, just who the principal O-one is for. Even if this is a material change, The eligibility of these persons having skill sets which are not readily found in the United States and being persons that support the organization. Of which. same exact organization is already established via visa approvals. Now write up this clause setting up the best stage. All right, I'm actually going to put it here first because I have more information. And then I'll bring it into Cloud to fix this up. Yeah, so Google will clean it up. All right, it's giving us some nice law. Perfect. Really happy with this output. They're not happy enough. Right, so I'm asking you to write a much better response based on this. Yeah, this is really good. Really happy with this output. Okay, now I want you in order that is presented in the request for evidence. List every naysay that they have and match it up with the exact page numbers and excerpts of where this was already addressed. Be detailed and use as many tokens as you need and ask to continue if necessary. Okay, so basically now I'm asking you to list everything that they said was wrong in RFE, then point to the exact pages and excerpts in the evidence already presented that is there. I want to tell Claude, I want you to write the preamble portion that explains what explains what the information that would result from above would address. So don't address it directly, but set up the next bit of information that will be this direct response. I like it. Okay, let's see what we got over here. Oh, I already had the RFU. And you know, we'll use this. Here it is. And here is some devils. Use this to help further tailor the strengths of our arguments based on the information we already presented. make this output much stronger. We want page numbers and excerpts for each and every NASEC for each beneficiary as appropriate. Tokens as you need and ask to continue. So we're going to have to let it think through this. Ideally, it'd probably take a bit of time since it has to line up the numbers and stuff like that and be really thorough. OK. So Suresh. I've also worked with them in the Abu Dhabi tournament. Can you please look up Suresh Reynos? tournaments in the United States and also in Abu Dhabi. Oops, I need to go there. Make sure you're still recording. Cool. Now give me a list of these URLs in order so that I can have someone download these as PDFs. Then make a that addresses this as Suresh Arena as competed in the tournaments produced by the beneficiaries. Yes, we don't need to do that. So this one is. So we got here. Mm-mm-mm-mm. Yes, give me the table for each exhibit. This one's still thinking. Just the right. No, we don't need that. Stop it. Actually let's let it continue. Yep, this is actually great. I wasn't even anticipating that. Oh, see, that's why we live called Claude. Just be going off. Sometimes it just knows what you need and we'll just make it happen. But you gotta feed it the right information. Yeah. Oh. So then you can cross this. Oh, no. Oh, there it is. OK, there's a detailed itinerary. I'll do this now. Write an updated letter from US Masters T-TEN confirming the role of Suresh Raina as So now I'm saying, now write a letter from the organization about Suresh Raina, how his role is bigger than just cricket, and then confirm previous work together and going forward. That is in the best light of the other information in this petition, this response. I'm actually kind of having fun with this. Right where we're doing that. Let's see how this goes. Okay, this is where this will go. All right, and then we'll get to the other one. Go ahead. Right, so we don't have to put duplicates. All right. That looks good. you Uh-oh. So your petition here, da-da-da-da-da-da-da, Central Sports App. So that's the letter. Okay, so now like we're making new evidence now. Okay, a support letter from Suresh Raina confirming all that we want to be in this petition about the, Then we'll actually take this, download it as a PDF. I think I'm going to save it because I haven't saved it yet. Okay. So we can use that as a reference to where we're already at. I'm going to ask it, okay. Then we'll check it. We'll check it for potential windfall. Okay. So. left, rotation. Together, if they exist, they probably don't. to ask for leads if they exist. Oh, I want to stop. Okay. Media coverage showing relationship, expert testimonials, Write it. And what's the final one? Term and credentials are official at all. Okay, then three. Now, add to this. Show pages. We also could use information about the actual Try a minute to update the actual itinerary. Sam army to feature response. make the message from Sherrod Seward to Ritesh. All right. And that's it. The rest we'll just send off and have a conversation with the client. But Forty-one minutes in, that's what it took, and we have a great response. So let's wait until the next time, and we are out of here. I hope you got some benefit for this. Until next time.",,x,x,,

This is Attorney Sheriff Seward and Ankit. And we were just working on a visa petition for a shot putter from Saudi Arabia. which brought us to the thing that we need to create a two thousand twenty five version of the itinerary. I look like we had a little late. OK, we're back. So I'm going to add this to the stage and get started. So we. It's. All right, we're back. So basically, we need to do is make a list of all the major track meets that happen in the United States over this year. OK, so we'll start with that. And we're using Cloud for this. They now can look up stuff on the internet, which is very helpful. So I think this is the best tool on the market. For some reason, it's not. Hold on. Oh, that's why. too many computers up. Here we go. Okay. Hello, we are looking to know what are the premier track and build events that occur in the United States in that are sponsored for Olympic pre-qualification. Make this list now after searching the internet. Trying to think, who's the last track and field person we did for Trent? Oops. I'm going to go into my drive. see if I can find a petition that's already done while it's searching for that. Okay, so now, okay. So we are now making an itinerary for track athletes that are obtaining P-one visas. They need the most robust schedule of events in the United States to get the P-one. Can you give me the full list of events occurred or are occurring in the United States this in uh in two thousand twenty five that satisfy this description okay so in the meantime you can go look and see if the Google Drive has come up and um it's named Maya Yeah, so we use this one because she's a great client of ours that represented Britain. Oh, that's not what I wanted. So many files, so many files. This one is good. Let us support version one. So we're going to download that. Download this. And this is our oral consent. We'll get this too. Yeah. Grab that too. The reason this will provide us some more context. Okay, let's upload this file. Upload a couple files. Definitely. Okay. Look at this for context. We need only the events that foreign nationals can compete in and also Give us the reasons why in bullet points. These are events that require the participation of internationally recognized athletes. And for each listing also, I know I'm spelling wrong. It's fine. Give us links and bullet points to support these assertions. Give this complete long detailed breakdown in the canvas or writing section just as we liked it to be formatted. Search the web. Is it going to do it here? OK. Oh, this is actually really good. OK. Now keep all of this. Information. But also infer that these events happen every year and then at the end for two thousand twenty eight state. Olympic. Games. L.A. as part of the itinerary for this. Keep in mind that the context is that this will be used over as itinerary template for track and field athletes looking for P-one visa. Now redo this and ask me to continue if you run out of tokens. All right. So then we click that, and then we should be off to the races. So then what Ankit's going to go and do is... Oh, those punks. So I'm going to give him this, but then I'm going to... Give him the list of links for each event, so he can print those out and then we'll put into a nice PDF that says here's the event here's the profile. First, like homepage of the event and then the support letters next event boom boom boom and then we'll see that these are likely to reprieve annually. And what we can location that they're that they are in. And this will be a beautiful. Beautiful template for all the track athletes out there to use. And I'm really happy. Okay. Oh, did I just go past it? No, I didn't. Actually, I think I did. Let me do it this way. Okay. So what I'll do is I'll take this and put this into a new tab. So we can save it as a PDF. And then we'll ask for the links for all of these next. And that'll be it for this one. Working hard today. All right, so. Pace. Yeah. P one and. Oh one track itinerary. We should write it. Share sports visas. Innovative Global Talent Agency. Alright, and we'll save this as a PDF. Now make a list of these in order, but include all of the links for each event that will provide the supporting information for each These will be printed off as PDFs and included with the itinerary explanation as part of P-one and O-one. These positions. All right, so then, Kit, I'll get this to you. I got to run or something. But I'll email this to you, and then we'll go from there. And then everybody out there, I hope you find this advantageous. I think that this itinerary is going to be very robust, and it can be used for pretty much any sport that's in world athletics, whether it be polo, shot put, pole vaulting, long distance, short distance. It's all good. Right, with that being said, look out for the template and we'll see you in the Knowledge Hub.",,x,x,,
May.04.2025,Sherrod Seward - Supa agent description,Other Video,Sherrod Seward - Supa agent description,Sherrod Seward - Supa agent description.mp4,Sherrod Seward - Supa agent description.mp3,"Hey, how's it going? Thank you for all that you've been doing so far. What I want to make is the best like super agent ever. That'd be like an easy sell to like just like anybody. And it would be kind of out of the box, you know, like, hey, we've got the automation right here. We'll hook it up, switch a couple of things for you. but there's three things that it does. Now, if it can't do all three things, that's fine, I'll take the social media. But if it's souped up to like where it can do all three, then it's great. The first one is, can it do the social media run? The second thing is, can it do the email thing, which means basically extract email information, maybe even LinkedIn information and be able to send it back. from there like say like hey give me you know what let's add that on later let's just get to the social media part now this social media part is we're looking at if somebody has several brandings um if they are particular about the um thumbnails with those and the primary platforms that we're looking at is facebook instagram X, LinkedIn, and YouTube. So each of these platforms have their own kind of style that's good for these places. They have their own limitations when it comes to characters, and they have their own different ways that you can post. For example, Facebook is pretty wide open. YouTube is either a short or a video. Um, Instagram is a, a real or a picture. Um, Twitter is, uh, you know, like a post that comes with a, um, a picture or a link. LinkedIn is the same, usually longer, uh, script there. Things of that nature and the audience is different. So we want it to be, have agents that can, um, that can kind of decipher which one it's going to and how it has to modify the copy and the audience of the copy for it to work. In this case, I'd like the input to be either email, Telegram, and I think there was one more, email, I think email and Telegram is fine as far as the input that you can put in there. And then, Maybe if you like insert a file into a sheet or into like a Google Doc. So let's say I record a video. Maybe I can record a video and I put it into Telegram before I record a video. And then I put it into an email and then send it to myself. That could work. Or if I take a video and then I upload it into a certain Google Drive, then it starts saying like, hey, I noticed you looked at some content. What would you like to do with it? Oh, I would like to have it be made into a Instagram post for shared sports visas and also a LinkedIn post. So kind of things we need to do is I have these here, which I'll send to you. which are like kind of the expected flows and copies if somebody was doing it manually. So if I said like this video is for serious sports visas, we expect it to create a thumbnail. It would apply the intro to the video, a transition and a transition and outro. So that would have the intro fade, the video fade, the outro. And then like, that's it. and that would be the video part, and the thumbnail would be made out of that. It would be great if it would talk to me to see if it needed more information, and then even give me the proof, like, you know, what they want to say before it goes out, and then have that posting structure there that has the best efforts, I mean, the best practices of what's good for each medium. You know, so like, you know, we can't have a Twitter post that has, Five hundred characters, but you could have a LinkedIn post that has it longer than that, but that's pretty much like what I'm looking for But I know that you might be aware of Different type of features. I haven't even thought about that are possible with it It would be great to keep the cost down by having okay for the image generation I for my own I would like to use a GP GPT for the new one that they have out because it's very good at creating text ones and For my own, it might be nice too if there's a way to do an animated one. So if I do a video that's short and stuff like that, it can be ran through an automation that would produce an animated one, basically doing video to video. switching the voice up and maybe having it be in the Chinese one saying it, things like that. But that's the type of flexibility that I'm looking for. Once we do that, maybe we can make it even better by adding like email features too. So it's just like the ultimate super agent that we can give the people, hook up their own APIs and then just get them running and stuff like that. I think that would be",,,,,
May.01.2025,IGTA - Boxing Itinerary Contract Issues,IGTA,IGTA - Boxing Itinerary Contract Issues,IGTA - Boxing Itinerary Contract Issues.mp4,IGTA - Boxing Itinerary Contract Issues.mp3,"How's it going, everybody? This is Sherrod Seward and Serge Ushkevich. And we are attorneys that specialize in combat sports. And right now we're going to get ready to talk about detail, nitty gritty. So hopefully don't get too nerdy on you. But this is important for all the combat sports athletes out there, especially the one they're getting ready to participate in the new big boy. So Serge, why don't you introduce yourself and the issue that we're talking about? And then let's see how we can solve this problem. Yeah, hi, everybody. I'm Serge from Serge Yushkevich. Sorry, I'm Serge Yushkevich from Yushkevich Athletic Immigration, PLLC. And right now we have a piece going on through a major new boxing promotion. And yeah, there's some unique questions that I think relate to the itinerary and the petition structure. Excellent, excellent. So with that being said, in combat sports, itineraries can be a bit of an issue, especially when it's not the promoter that is applying for the visa. I've personally litigated a lot on this issue. First, I was winning, and then they got a little aggressive. But it's caused us to really get fine-tuned with how we approach these issues when there is an agent or another company that is filing for visas, but the fighters will be actually competing in a much larger promotion. So with that being said, I'll let Serge get into some of the details of what the problem is, and then we're going to problem-solve around it. OK, so the first thing is that the athlete is going to be competing in the new UFC boxing promotion. We need to show that it has a distinguished reputation in the sport and requires an internationally recognized athlete. Sometimes USCIS can be more strict when it's a new league and they focus on a requirement that's actually not in the statutes, but it's basically only in the regulations. that the promotion needs to have a distinguished reputation. So we believe that the creative solution that might be to frame the boxing promotion as the bigger company, TKO Holdings, which also includes the WWE and the UFC. The second question is related to petition structure. So there are different agent requirements depending on whether the agent is performing the function of an employer, acting as an employer, acting as an actual employer or representing multiple employers. In this case, it doesn't really fit into any of the boxes that USCIS has kind of artificially created because the athlete has a four-year contract And it's pretty clear that they'll be exclusive to the boxing promotion. With that being said, the contract is only triggered after eighteen months, eighteen months after signing. And sometimes you can say, well, that's speculative because what if the promotion doesn't end up triggering the clause where they where they actually have the athlete compete there? All right. So there's a couple parts to this. First, let's talk about does the activity require athletes that need will require international participation. So one thing I would work with here is I like the idea of working with the bigger company and not just the boxing promotions itself. One is because there's a prospectus. Whenever a company is publicly traded, there's a certain type of information they have to have out there to explain how robust that they are. Right. So I would tie it into that because at first I was unclear if it was Dana White's just own thing he's doing on his side. But if it is TKO boxing, I would go and and run with that as far as it being a TKO promotion. That way you can point to that. They have to publicly disclose how robust they are. and also compare them to the other promotions and organizations that they deal with to say they'll be at the same level. This is how much money is being invested. So, of course, they have to have the best talent from around the world, just like every other one that they have to do that. So if it is indeed the case that this is not Dana White's baby, but this is TKO's project, use TKO to their advantage, point to the publicly disclosed documents, and make it aligned with the other organizations that are there. The next question we were talking about was agent structure. This one gets tough, but there's a couple of things to look at. One is because the contracts, if they're coming from TKO and there's disclosure, there's a certain thing that they're going to want to say. Dealey, they like to look big. So they look like they have multiple like employees, right? Because it used to be if you look at a promotional contract with the UFC, a lot of people have seen them. It says that they're independent contractors and responsible for getting their own visas. Perhaps that might have changed now that they've been publicly traded or they like to stay in the gray area. As you know, the UFC has been involved in antitrust lawsuits before this. So which means they have to be careful about how they say people are contractors with employees. I think that leaning into the TKO thing and just not want to fight with both them and the UFC, you want to look at it like, OK, it's going to be hard to say that the fighter's an independent contractor and stay on the good side of TKO. Now, if their contract looks like it says, do you know if the contract calls them independent contractors? It does? I need to double check. I actually don't think, I know the UFC won't say that. I don't remember the contract using that. And it's through like a T a company that TKO holds. So kind of how UFC is Zufa it's through the separate company that they made for boxing. But I think that that's probably a road. So then the best case scenario would be is if there's somebody over there that would sign like a multiple employer agreement, because if they are the employer, then, um, We can do a multiple employer agreement that's very bare bones. We have a version of that that we do that just basically says we give permission for this petitioner to sign off as their petitioner for immigration purposes and that, you know, we're their employer for this sake. And it does, it's very vague, so it's like, you know, they might earn this much money, but it says at least this. It's very vague on what it does and it only has a couple lines for saying here and here. In the past, the UFC has been very conservative when it comes to kind of doing these things. But if Zufa boxing or TKO boxing is not going to be in the business of doing all the visas themselves, they're going to have to bend over somewhere to accommodate getting consistent results. So basically, I'm saying hopefully they would sign something or at least in the email saying, hey, we're OK with this agent petitioner signing the petition for this person. Then you can file it as U.S. agent for multiple employers, even though there's only one. Okay. Even though there's only one. Okay. So now it's like they're going to take some time to get revved up. I think you were saying it's going to take eight, eighteen months before they actually start doing anything. Correct. All right. Does the contract say anything about what the fighters can do or are they getting paid or anything before that time? It says that they need to get approval if they want to take a fight before then. Um, and it doesn't say it in the contract. Um, but in reality, what's going on is that they're going to the specific fighter. There's two of them. They're going to be on the first events, which are going to be, um, earlier than that, eight month window. Um, and there's a lot of media online saying that the fighters get access to the UFC performance Institute, um, different UFC facilities around the world and so on. All right. Well, there's technically nothing in the regulations that say you have to start by a certain time. So that's one thing that's there that we could use to advantage. And then also to fill in that gap, I would try to say they will be competing and performing at the UFC Institute, which obviously has other people that have international recognition. um I think that there's also um pictures and videos online of zufa and tko boxing having their own boxing rings and things of that nature so you can put into the petition that they'll do be doing international training sessions and exhibition matches sparring at the facilities of the employer and then kind of stack it with information showing that they have a boxing ring all these other people are able to use it and then um use the idea that there's a lot of going into these first events that that's why they need international recognition because everything has to be top of the notch. This promotion is looking to be the best promotion in the world. And so I think that's the best way to do it. Call the sparring sessions international expositions and call them international training sessions. Stack it with examples of other international athletes using it and then talk about how state of the art it is. And then like maybe even say, hey, you just can't walk in there, say there's no memberships that you can buy online for it to do. So this is interesting, and that's out there. But I think of the three questions that you asked, that's the best way to address those ones. And for anybody out there that's in the same boat, if you are looking to compete in TKO boxing and want to get your paperwork in order, you know who to call. We're on this. We're solving these problems actively. So don't be shy. Have a good one.",,x,x,,

We'll do that, and then we'll touch base next week about some dates. We will get those. I'm out of the office, and my assistant is out of the office today. Oh, I remember that. So we'll get that stuff. I'll file the forms. Excuse me. I'll submit the ADR form today, and then next week. I'm going to look at this one. right right yeah I will do that um I'll make the announcement and then I'll attach the mediation form to that because I believe it's the same email address amber goals right I believe it's the same person yes Never mind. Yeah, it's, you know, I understand. So thanks for giving me a call back. I'll get that email out right now. So I'm going to go back. And, you know, we'll touch base next week about getting those records to you. So I want to duplicate. And we'll try and alter out some of these. All right, you too. Thank you. Killing it. All right, so this is the client representation intake link. So what I'm going to do for now. Sarah, man, you get your stuff off the floor. Are you on the phone? What? I was recording some pictures and stuff. All right, so what we're going to do with this funnel is take this basic inquiry that we just duplicated, but we're going to make it automatically go somewhere else when they fill it out. Now, I also need this to send a message with this contact info where we need to go so we can see where people go. I will give an email address for that. But what I need, form settings, On submit. So on submit. We want to open a URL. So we're going to go back and go. This is like putting a bandaid on it really should just make another one. I'm going to make it go to an old form we already have in a different subaccount. Switch to subaccounts. Sites. Forms. Wait a minute. Okay, it's here. This form. So I'm going to copy the link. Actually, I'm going to duplicate it first. I'm making a different one because on submission, this is going to go to that new AI tool that Yusuf's doing. Which knowing him will not take long. So. What is this? So it's been shared, but what I need is the URL. For it. Should be readily available. All right, cool. Here it is. So now when somebody submits this one, it would automatically go to this one. We could probably use some uniformity. So somebody fix that after me. Let's go make sure that saved. It is good. So then let's save this. Now let's also get the link for this. And this is the one that will be used in this web page. All right. So that's it for this one.",,,,,

This is Attorney Sherrod Seward, and I have the pleasure of working through a petitioner form on Francis Ngannou's O-I-A petition. If you don't know him, he's one of the most famous combat sports athletes in the world. Former UFC champion is now working with PFL and doing a lot of great projects. So right now I'm going to work through his petitioner form to show you how it works and kind of talk about the ideas behind it. It won't even take very long. So I'm going to present my screen. Let's hop straight into it. So to find this document, innovativeglobaltalent.com backslash petitioner form. And that'll take you straight to it. This one has some pre-populated information because we're We've already been through this a little bit with somebody else. That being said, you could always just write over it. So that goes to the date that we put today's date. Innovative Global Talent Agency is the petitioner. Let's make sure he's found the champ's name right. Sometimes those ends get pretty tricky. All right. So we got the name right. If applicable, multiple employer one, we'll put Friars League as a multiple employer, secondary employer. we can get this out. So that should be fine for this one. He does have some other employers, but we can put that as self-employed activities. So one is USHA for foreign employers, self-employed, USHA for multiple employers, and we won't do any direct employment here. All right. So here's where we put information about why this is one of the most famous combat sports athletes in the world who now does partnerships as a entrepreneur and active athlete. The agent. Petition is necessary. To accomplish. All of the great things. Great. The beneficiary. Will continue to do over the next. Three years. Okay. Here we're going to change to world class combat sport. Direct employment activities. We're saying NA. Directed by agents. And A, self-employment. Say compete in self-negotiated world-class events. EFL. Because that's where he does his combat sports in. We add. Season events. Multiple employer activities. So here we play. Will compete and serve as an ambassador with Professional Fighters League. Okay, we can get rid of that too. I actually need to put some more self-employment activities in here too. It will serve as an Self, uh, raise, um, coach and training center. So basically I'm saying he's going to be doing combat coaching and training center building and may, uh, activations. Sponsorships and other appearance. Here's going to put at least two hundred fifty thousand per year. It's probably going to be way more, but we're just putting like a low estimate on there. And that's it. Yeah, that's a choice of signatures and that should be fine. And so what we'll do now from here is give multiple employer forms to re-add season and to PFL so that they can confirm those things. Then also we like to get this and say like, you know, acting. So we can get his just proof of that he does act and stuff like that. So instead of actually printing him, which I'll do is I'll show you what we get. So he's in films here. So we'll grab that. Well, I'll just make a note of it somewhere. Then say Francis PFL Ambassador. Oh wow. So you have that there. I said PDF. I meant to say PFL. Why did you guys tell me that? Open that link. Look at this, four points and AP News. Let's talk about his deal here. And I'll show you what the multiple employer form looks like. So we go to www.innovative. So I believe that's the URL. We'll see in a second. Yeah, and that's it. That's it right there. So then we'll send those to PFL and other kind of partners that he has for that. So that I appreciate your attention to this.

This is Sherrod Seward with Ankit. And we are getting ready to write a P-One visa support letter for a MMA fighter previously signed with the UFC, probably signed again. But now he's getting ready to do some new boxing, dirty boxing. with mike perry's promotion and first round management um so let's get into it first we're going to start with the tools that we use in our school the shared sports visas community which is right here as you can see and not only in the community what you get is a lot of things but if you see here that's one of the most important links because that'll get you right into the super database of tools, which has the tools that we're going to use today to do these visas. And as you can see, we're just now getting started. It's brand spanking new, but we're going to keep adding things to it. So in this one, we're going to use the two thousand four, two thousand twenty four version of the P-one visa, which we have right here. And I'm going to go ahead and make a copy and call it Ikaro Hoos. Carro Brito, P-one A, Dirty Boxing, FRM. So I'm gonna make a copy, so that way I don't mess up my original one. The next tool, I'm gonna get rid of this tab, we don't need more, that I'm gonna use is, I'm gonna go to our legal stuff, and this is where we keep our AI tools that help us out. And I'm going to grab the, I'm going to grab this one right now. I'm going to grab this launch tool. This is the visa support letter writer, but I'm going to use it to do the, to do his visa to help us out. So I'm going to download it as a PDF. And then also I have his exhibit so far. I'm going to download that as a PDF. So I think I am. And then. We have some links. That I want to grab. Over here. Alright, so let's go to our tool. And then we're going to upload our documents. So we have these up here. And then we have these links and then I'm going to prompt it to get started. you are the best p-one visa support letter writer in the nation we need you to first go through and understand all of these documents so we can write portions of the p-one visa for this athlete portion by portion. Go through and crawl the links. Report out what you find. Okay? I'm also gonna share this document with Ankit right now so he can actually write in there too as we're going through this. Make it very collaborative. All right, you can go ahead and I'll open this up too, just in case I need you to help me out. So the petitioner's name. I'll get you to switch it. Who's the actual petitioner name, the official one? I'll let him put that in. While he's going through, he's going to put the official name of the petitioner right there and the beneficiary while we get started. I'll go back to the GPT and make sure that it's prompting okay. Okay. Can you make sure that you crawled all of the links? All right, so this one, they're not an agent this is direct employment so I'm getting rid of that because it's direct employment this is for direct employment and so uh this you can leave alone and right here for p ones we like to do three years from data for pool And here it goes like that, attached agreement. The attached petitioner, which we're gonna do again. We're gonna do that too. All right, so this one goes and see if they have been previously approved in the same visa category. So this one, it's been approved by the UFC, but he's changing his employer. So we can't use this one. So we get rid of this, so it shows that the beneficiary has been previously approved in the same category, and then we go like that. So what's the petitioner's name? Hopefully he has it in there, Dirty Boxing Championship. So go ahead and take this, put this here, and we'll give some information about this. All right. Okay, so I'll go here and it'll be like, Give us this portion of the petition. Oops. So I'm just going to say give us this portion. And I need to make sure it says Dirty Boxing Championship LLC. I'm going to scoot this over here so it's next to it. Oh, looks like it didn't copy. Dirty Boxing Championship LLC. And that's basically how it is to it. Like we got to keep in knowledge the context that we have and look out for hallucinations as we go. But since we loaded it with such quality information and the quality of the prompt behind it, we usually get it pretty good. So that looks good. So we'll go ahead and put that there. Me, I like to get rid of the exited part. Because, you know, sometimes I don't put document numbers and stuff like that. Okay, I'm gonna say, write this about Icaro. Now we're writing the go-to about the beneficiary. Oh, that reminds me. One thing we need to do with mixed martial artists is that we do not call them that. We don't call them MMA athletes. We call them world-class combat sports athlete. Field of expertise, combat sports, because this is for boxing. So generally when we're talking about mixed martial artists, we use combat sports athletes. So that way they can compete in different sports. Otherwise it'd be like, hey, that's not an MMA fight. You shouldn't be getting a P one for that. Call him a world-class combat sports athlete and make it so the sports aren't I am a hybrid nature of DBX. Go. Okay, so. Nice, so now we have it here to like where it's talking about his mix. Writing background, which is what we want more than just saying just in the name. So inspired, eleven is just calling you. No, no mention that when that stuff comes on. Alright, so we're putting this. And then. We don't have a foreign employer. So for consultation letter there isn't one in dirty boxing. So we're going to take this. We just really much take like this whole thing. Alright. Want to cut it out? We'll go here and say. Use and make the version This is a new sport, and there is no appropriate labor union or organization besides this organization itself to do the support letter. OK, write it up. So basically I'm saying pick the version of the advisory opinion that goes for this and do that. So I did a really good job of describing that there is no labor union. And that this is a distinct sport. Regular tour requirements. So I get off that. Depending on the situation of the team. So this one, we're going to say explain that he does not, but was previously signed and approved promoter of mixed martial arts and the world the UFC right this up time is really going that easy to take time to do right but this should be a lot longer if we didn't have this tool I think we'll try to do something else like for this part. I think we'll try to do all the lesser categories at once. So we'll go put that here. I'm actually going to do a different thing for international recognition. This is especially true because he is already previously approved. So I'm gonna take a different approach to this. So I'm gonna say, I say analyze all of this, but do not give an output. So basically what I wanted to do is not point to specific things, but say this person has been previously approved in the documents that support that or provided with this petition. And tell it not to point out specific things, but to basically say information for these categories were included. So not point out specific documents, but we just want to say that these documents were previously approved and for the categories that apply should be applicable again for all of the categories that apply for him. But be vague and tell an instructor to look to the documents. Make it similar to the argument style made in these O-A template. So I'm gonna go back to Shared Sports Visas and I'm gonna go to our templates and I'm gonna download this O-A. And I'm downloading it because Because I like the way that the arguments are done. Actually, I'm just going to download the whole thing and see how good it does. So let's go back to our ChatBeatGPT. Let's see. Be sure to make the arguments for P one A, not O one A. Just use similar arguments. or lesser categories only. All right, it's doing its thing. Oh, so it's actually hallucinating. No. Only use categories that actually apply from the documents and links we've provided. It should be international rankings, awards, publications, and expert opinions, governing body, and anything else you actually have on this athlete. Do not make stuff up. Okay, here we go. Let's see what we have. Okay, that works good. We'll use that. Now you won't do that all the time, but they're previously approved and we want them to just kind of look towards those documents. Now this one should say P one. And you got the e-signatures there. We're not going to use this sample petitioner's agreement. Instead, we're going to make another one so we can get rid of that. And that one's done. Let's go check it for date. What's the date today? It's three, thirteen, two thousand twenty five. All right. all right is that now let's get to the petitioner agreement which we have here and you can also find these this in the school when you go to petitioner it qualifies petition what is under practitioner resources oh so it's there it's under practitioner resources you can go to petitioner form view form and it'll be right there But I already have it uploaded. So let's go through it. So this has some previous information just because my browser is kind of old. I mean, it has it in my browser already. So this would be Dirty Boxing Championship LLC. This should be. Secondary employer. How do you spell it? How do you spell it? We don't have a matter. S-I-L-V-A. Okay. Yep. Details Uh-oh, no secondary employers. Direct employer in this one. In this one, we don't need anything. So we can just get out and say NA, not applicable. And here we say not applicable. We would change that. I wonder why it still has his stuff in here. So there's a world class combat sports athlete. Forms duties, direct employment, say compete in events that require the participation of internationally recognized athletes. Starting on April, was that the fight? What's that? Yeah, March the twenty-second. March the twenty-second. Yeah. That's why I have this. All right, so we can skip all that. And like even we can ask for like five years, right? We don't because that will invite them to deny the petition. They're not going to give five years really right now for combat sports. So they always do three on the first one and then we do five on the renewal. All right. It seems that the template has been. Right. So then what we do is this one's pretty much done. We did fifty thousand per year, which represents how much we'll think and make over the course of a year for that. We do have some work to do because like this one, since we did it already in this browser has some signatures there. So we'll go ahead and take care of that. But this is how you do it. And we look forward to the next video.",,x,x,,
March.14.2025,SSV - Icaro Brito - MMA - Itinerary and Agent Based Contracts,Immigration Sports,SSV - Icaro Brito - MMA - Itinerary and Agent Based Contracts,SSV - Icaro Brito - MMA - Itinerary and Agent Based Contracts.mp4,SSV - Icaro Brito - MMA - Itinerary and Agent Based Contracts.mp3,"I don't want to stand up. How's it going, everybody? This is Sherrod Seward and Ankit with Sherrod Sports Visas. Say hello, Ankit. Hello. And what we're doing now is we're doing a itinerary portion of a P-one visa for first round management client, Icaro Brito, who's previously been in the UFC and still might be in the UFC as long as we can get a visa situation together. A lot of times the UFC will not take a fighter that has a P-one and they tend not to want to get involved with kind of difficult situations. So that's when the agent, in this case, first round management, who is one of the biggest, probably the biggest mixed martial arts management company in the world, to serve as his petitioner and get him a P-one visa that lasts multiple years and he'll be able to fight in multiple promotions on this P-one approval. All right, with that being said, let's get into the itinerary portion of that, of this. My screen is already shared. Uh, but I'll go and, um, start grabbing some documents. So the one I'll grab is depending on how long some, oh yeah, there we go. Dirty boxing championship. So what I'll do. is I'll start grabbing stuff about the petitioner, especially if they are prominent. And that's because this proves that they have a history of doing, of sending people to the top promotions. So it helps create the argument that because they're represented by first round management, more likely or not, they will participate in the events that we put up. So if I have never managed a fighter before, but I say, hey, yeah, my fighter is going to fight in UFC, it doesn't carry as much weight as first round management who has several clients in the UFC already. I really like the new website. This is new. Yeah. So I'll grab this too. This also serves as information on the petitioner. I wonder if they have like clients. So then we can go to lot clients and, um, Oh, look, they're doing influencers too. And boxing and basketball. Wow. They're all over the place. So now we're going to grab the list of people that are in the UFC. I know it's twenty four pages, but that's fine. Okay. So now what we're going to do is start establishing that he does have things to do in the United States. And we have a couple of tools here to help us do that. One is that he's already been in the UFC. As we can see here, he just had like a little bit of a visa issue. So that's going to be helpful since we have the UFC Acumen there, we can go UFC, sorry, UFC schedule ESPN, two thousand twenty five. Well, they're going to Mexico City. On March twenty ninth, who would have been awesome to go to, I would have loved to go to that. Maybe I can't. Ooh, maybe I can, I might try to go to that. Yeah. Hmm. That's looking nice. Okay. So we've got that. Um, the next thing we have that's very helpful is that we have a ballot agreement. So, uh, here's his doubt agreement that he's going to be with bare knuckle, um, known as the dirty boxing championship. So this is important. Yeah, the petitioner will be like Dirty Boxing Championship LLC in this case. No, that would not be the petitioner. That would just be part of his itinerary. The petitioner is first round management, but they're promoting this fight. And what our job is to do is show that Dirty Boxing Championship is important. So because we can't have fights that don't require the participation of international athletes. So that's why we're going to go here. And this is the important part, because this is really what, because here's the part you need to know about P-ones. If you can be the best athlete in the world, but if the competitions that you're saying you're going to compete in are not big, established things, or like supposed to be, you're not going to get approved because they're going to say your itinerary doesn't require internationally ranked athletes. So that's why this bout agreement, we have to show that Dirty Boxing Championship is really important. This is what makes or breaks this petition. Because they can come and say that the UFC is not about to happen because he's not currently signed there, even though he has been. And he will be as soon as he gets his visa situation correct. So Dirty Boxing Championship, what we're looking now is independent, right? So we're looking for independent verification that this is a big deal. So we have PR Newswire, we have press release. What we're looking for is, reputable sources that are talking about this promotion so okay look bam mma junkie great yahoo sports bleacher report bloody elbow this is great so this is great because it's showing that the promoter is uh covered by the biggest kind of outlets out there in combat sports. So when we do this, we're going to want to get the article, of course, but we also want to get the about us of that news outlet so we can show later that it is a big deal. So that's why Malky really wants this. Okay, so maybe we do that to hurry up. Advertise without terms of use. SB Nation. So I'm looking for the about us of this website. A lot of times it'll be hiding down here somewhere. Maybe guidelines YouTube. Okay, let's see if this is it. Nope, looks like it's just going to go to the homepage. Let's go like this. Does it have a search option? It doesn't look like it. But the good thing, this is all good news that this is here. Oh, here we go. I think this is what we're looking for. But we're basically looking to see the prowess. How big and reputable is this place? So while it's doing that, we'll go and grab this Instagram. Looks like we have some latency. So while these are loading, let's see if the websites that we have. OK. So we're having some issues. So what I'm going to do is pause it while these load up. We're back. Let's get this going. So here we have the About Us of that media outlet. I don't know if I could do that later. yesterday I did that I think what I'll do is I'll gather the links and then I'll save them for later so we don't have this um printing issue while we're going to pdfs that's fine I'll just uh okay we're up and what we decided to do and we're probably going forward is not like breaking through printing this these to pdfs but do know what we are doing is making pdfs of these of these to be arranged later and um we'll have a video probably an arranging and some of the ai tools we use to do that pretty quickly all right so I'm grabbing their instagram because they do have a hundred and something thousand followers which is very helpful for showing the breadth of it. This is from the PR Newswire, which is the official kind of like press release place that everybody uses to get their press releases. And then once you put something on PR web, that's when other outlets start to pick up on it. And then they make their determinations from there. So right now I'm just grabbing the URLs, but what you want to do for all of these is later go back in and then get the about us for all this. See MMA Junkie is really good because you can see it's affiliated with USA Today, which is one of the major news outlets in the United States. This is Yahoo Sports. I mean, everybody knows who Yahoo is. They used to be right up there with Google. Now not so much. You got to get in where you've been in. Stay competitive out here. Bleacher Report is, I forget who they're with, but they're also heavily affiliated. Oh, so he's revealing his new dirty boxing championship before the Jake Paul fight. That's great. Okay. So we got that. First round management, we got that. All right. So I think I'm satisfied here with what we have, especially if he's going to be petitioning directly through first round management and this dirty boxing. If he's also doing the UFC, then I would put the UFC schedule in there and explain that first round management has a great history of placing athletes in the UFC and that he was already kind of signed in the UFC. So that being said, I'm going to go give those links over to Amkit, who will later go process those and put them in the itinerary portion of the folder. And then next, what we'll do is write the support letter. So see you in the next video.",,x,x,,
March.05.2025,IGTA - Creating Contract for MMA Fighter using AI,IGTA,IGTA - Creating Contract for MMA Fighter using AI,IGTA - Creating Contract for MMA Fighter using AI.mp4,IGTA - Creating Contract for MMA Fighter using AI.mp3,"Is it going to play the intro? All right. Well, I didn't get the intro. That's fine. Here with Ankit and we're going to write a contract. We have a situation where we have an MMA fighter, an MMA fighter who has a sponsor. Now he can't afford his whole fee. So basically we're going to say he can pay three thousand and then do some marketing for us. But then at the end of that three thousand, at the end of that marketing period, he can pay up the rest. The thing is, they want it on an actual contract. So what we're going to do is make this, we're going to make a template for a contract to use in similar cases where we have, we like somebody we'll do it for less money, but the money's still owed and they just have to do marketing until they get paid that amount. All right. So, um, let's, uh, let's train on chat GPT for this. Let's use, um, G a four point five, which is a new model that came out. That's supposed to be very expressive. Say like, okay. I need you to be a very skilled contract attorney that knows sports, entertainment, immigration, and talent agencies. I am going to present two different agreements. You will analyze and then ask me if you understand, ask for the two documents. So this way we get some skin in the game with the AI. We like to always confirm that they do understand. Understood. So we're going to take our talent services agreement is what we give to, actually we're taking the shared sports visas agreement. We're going to download as a PDF because AI usually reads PDFs better. Then we're going to take our petitioner agreement and put that as a PDF. Now let's go back and give them the documents and say analyze these and then ask me for more context on what we're trying to accomplish. Okay. Please analyze. these two contracts and then add the details even the minute details order etc to your knowledge for the rest of this prompt conversation and then ask me for more context of what we Now when it comes back, I'm going to spike it with the situation. I'm saying here's the situation and then I'll say what we just talked about. I wonder if this will work. I like this because it will allow me to talk straight into it if it works. English, allow mic access. What is that noise? All right. It's got a lot of stuff there. We like it. We like it. Let's see if we can talk to it. Okay. So here's the situation. We have an MMA fighter that can't afford their fees and it's a talent fee, not a legal fee. And typically we charge ten thousand dollars in their situation to do a P one visa or an O one visa, along with filing fees for MMA period. What we agreed to is that he can pay three thousand dollars now for a filing on regular processing and then be privy to doing some marketing for us. This marketing will be recruiting other talent to come to the petitioning service and doing some posts for us when he has an event, which in this case will be a fight with a promotion with a major broadcast deal. He will then be able to and entitled to pay the rest of the remaining balance and be free of the marketing. What we want you to do is to take these two contracts and make it so they are combined from the perspective of a talent agency, not a law firm, and have it to where there's a template space to where we can put the amount paid, the visa or service that we're going to provide, the ultimate amount due, and the services that will be done in the meantime for marketing, and then another blank space for what event will trigger a payment that will release them from the marketing. If you understand, please ask me for more questions before proceeding if needed. Yeah. That's how you prompt right there. That's how you prompt right there. Understood. Yes, this is correct. Comma, do not spare any tokens. If you need more tokens to complete a fully detailed agreement, please ask for permission to continue writing from the place that should be left off, period. Also, please remember to make the blank spaces for the custom variables in this, which include the amount of the initial payment, the amount of the total ultimately due, the visa-specific services provided, the marketing service that they will perform in the meantime, and the event or conditions that will trigger payment of the remaining balance. Period. Make this contract favorable to the talent agency, but not unconscionable. Now make me proud. Why is it not going to Canvas? Oh, there it is. Okay. Okay. Double your nose. Oh, he did it. Get rid of saying a visa type. What else do we not like? Not like that. Okay. For marketing, do not have anything that is preset in there. We want to customize all of this. No boilerplate. Okay. Termination breach. Oh, well, that's cool. So now Canvas should start remaking this. It's editing as we speak. Yeah. Actually, I need to update you regarding something. What's that? Actually, my friend's wedding is on the seventh, so I will not be available for the seventh, and for tomorrow as well, for the first half. So I will be available in the second half. No problem. Thanks for letting me know, and congratulations to your friend. Thanks. What in the world is this? Okay, no, no, no. Go back to the last version. Yeah, they just, yeah. See, that's why you got to tell them about tokens, because they're going to try to escape you out. and regarding the uh jeremy as well like the alley guy for which we have doing the p-one renewal in that case like we have done for with another agency so it will be not a new employment but the continuation but with the different employer um yeah yeah so it's not a renewal you just do it as a new petition and then say that they've already been approved before it's a new petition but you say they've been approved before yeah actually I have like I asked them that to continue but with the different employer I guess so that's why I just control no problem yeah yeah you do this new petition with igta So it's getting worse and worse. Let's see if we can get it back to where it was supposed to be. Should have just went with that first one. It must be in the chat, the previous one. Yeah, I just put the previous prompt in there. So we'll see how this. Let's go replace this. Replace image with. All right, that looks good. We just might have to manually do this one. Oh, come on. Let's take this off. Okay. We'll just... Liam, are you sick? Are you sick? We'll get you some medicine after this, all right? All right, so let's go through this. It's not a long one, that's fine. So it doesn't have to be MMA. Let's say talent consulting. And petitioner services. Did you, did you, did you do your nose? Yeah. Not to look at it. That's it. Yeah. Did you blow your nose? Alright, this looks good. Florida. And let's go anywhere. All right, so focus on the visas that you're already doing. I'll probably make some videos tomorrow doing Francis and the other fighters' research and stuff. So I'll just have that ready for you. But I'll do that as like a training type of thing. Anyway, but if you get to it, do their forms. Okay, sure. Right, so let's download this as a PDF. And then let's make it into a template. And sign now. So you need. These two by this week or by next week, because like. I just had a good day. If you get the forms together, I can maybe figure out the rest if I need to. But like if you do the forms, then I can send it if I if I need to. OK. So one, let's see, Francis is with IGTA, I marked that, and then Viccaro, Brito, is with First Round Management. I can send some, or like, you know, I'll give you their email so you can ask them of what you need for the petitioner, because I don't want to send it to the wrong address. Because they've had a couple. They've had a couple. Alright, so let's make a template. Oops. Little file to resend it multiple times. That's what I said I wanted to do. I wonder if you can have a template with multiple signers. We should. Well, we'll see. Managed recipients. So we might have to have two recipients. All right, so me fill out now. So recipient one will represent us. This will be recipient two. Actually, we should fill that out because they can just go put in another name. We're going to fill that out. We'll put the name of the person. put the visa type like we'll put the services here this again will be us I guess we're filling this out mostly yeah that's fine Alien be good. Alright. OK. So. Print name text. Late in time. That's for the signature and put me or put the needle works. Oh no, we'll put the date later. Oh, that's not supposed to be us. That's supposed to be recipient two. Paving time. All right, now the thing is, I think we should make the recipient, manage recipients. Like, this could always be the same. You okay? Yeah. I just thought you were doing work. I'm done. So we can make this info at a innovative global talent agency. Right. So that way we just always know that we're filling it from there and I'll go there. Okay. So let's save and close. Now, I've never really done one where it has two signers to see, like, how it kind of works. So you can create an invite link. All right, so I save that. And let's go make it into a custom URL. I'll never forget how they brought me home. What should we call it? We'll call it agreement terms, talent terms. So this one will be backslash talent. Why does that look different? Please tell me. Okay. I think somebody's messing with this. Because that button's supposed to be... Yeah, let's get out of here, because I think somebody's messing with it. Whatever. Let me mind my business. I was like, uh-oh. I'll never forget how we set me free. So to set up a custom URL, we go to Settings, Developer Tools, URL Mappings. We'll just scroll down to the bottom. No big deal. What I like to do is put it right here. the new link, take an existing one, go over here. This is where we'll put the talent terms. And this is where we'll place the link with the sign now, gently right there. Looks good to me, good to you. Save and then test. If this works correctly, it should go to signnow.com. It is. So we're good to go. And now let's go ahead and fill it out. Oh, wait. So it's just the talent part. So that's interesting. So like this will send to them, but we have to fill out our part. How do we do that? Like the info main ID, like main. Right, so yeah, IGTA talent. we can make the second recipient put their name and then like the whole signature and right and we can put the initial amount that's that's that's true how about that one hold on let me you want to redirect after completion I'll send it to So what are you saying to do? I'm saying, like, if we were putting that on the website, they can put their names as well. Like, the recipient two can put their name as well. And like, the amount we can like left after that and he can sign it from there like if we want to put it so he can put his name and then sign it on and we oh yeah so we just do more we do more stuff to it uh just have it to where you can sign it so but how do you let's ask chat So, I mean, there's got to be a way that you can send it. Oh, I think I know what it might do. I think I know what it might do. Hold on. I think I might have figured it out. I think it might be the case that it just goes to that other email. So when you send it, it automatically sends an invite over here to that email. I'll show you what I mean. Bella De La Costa. She wants a renewal. Okay. Let me just switch this. That's the wrong one. Yeah. Should be info at global talent agency. Now what am I expecting is there might be an invitation here. Yep. Your document. I think that name's just Kosong. I need to find that fighter's name. I don't remember his name. Okay, so his name is cussing said dogs are off but you cussing Saturday so I said I was going this are you know what we're not to do this again Because we have to send it to the same person. Like, if I fill this out, I don't know that they're getting the email that they need for theirs. So I'm gonna do it again. Okay, so I'm gonna do like here. Okay. Say Jake. Sorry this is taking so long, but it'll help us save time in the next one. We are backslash talent terms. That's right, right? Talent terms? Yeah. But one thing, they might not sign because there is no amount and specific amounts in the contract and the name. I got you. That's what I'm going to deal with. now I suspect that this is going to send another email okay let's see if it works but you also may be correct there's only one way to find out down say anything huh okay so then what we'll do is like We can always just fill it out and send it to them and then they can like figure it out and send it back to us. That might be what it is if they can't sign it electronically. OK, so this is a five. We can try it like both sides, like when the one we have already sent and like the one this one. So right. What's his name? Qasim Q. How do you spell it? Is that it? Is that right? All right, so it looks good. Is that his name? Is that his name? Is his name right? We have to check. I don't know. If I do. I guess it's Q. Q, yeah. Yeah, this one. Sardarov. Sardarov. Yeah, that's right. OK. Download my copy. Okay, so we can send it to info. I'll just download it. I didn't like the way that went. Yeah. So when this happens, we're better off just like, you know, we'll try it again like tomorrow or something. But this one I'm just going to send to him. But it's like, we might as well fill it out and then go back and assign now.com and do it again. Yeah. Because otherwise we'd have to set like an API flow and all that. So then we'll go back to Jake. Or we can put this in the sign now and put like the recipient one and then send them to sign it. Yeah, we can do that. Let's not be lazy. Mm. Um, no, I don't want to do that. Oh yeah, I did. Yeah, I did. Uh, that's fine. That's good. Cause even Joshua could see this and it'd be like, yeah, see the process. Save and close. I'll never forget how you set me free. Export the cloud. That's pretty cool. Wait, where is that? In the drafts. Oh. I guess you've been in here, huh? And like we can see that is the easier agreement or like the form. Yeah, yeah, this is the easier way, right? Join smash team.

All right, I'm about to start installing some new signatures so that we can use these in the automation instead of GLF. But these would just be for the automation. Okay, so one thing we need to make is that if people reply to this email using this, that it goes to where we need it to go. So that's what I'm working on now. I'm just putting all of these in, but all of these signature blocks also need to be placed in the actual signatures. of the email domain, just in case I need to send it out.

Feb.19.2025,GLF- IGTA - Intake Training - Module 4 - Lead Evaluation,Training Video,GLF- IGTA - Intake Training - Module 4 - Lead Evaluation,GLF- IGTA - Intake Training - Module 4 - Lead Evaluation.mp4,GLF- IGTA - Intake Training - Module 4 - Lead Evaluation.mp3,"is that saying for review okay we're back doing our thing with the intake training and uh what we're going to do is look at um how to do the status that they're in review to make sure somebody's even um qualified for the visa so There's a couple things we do to do this up. It just starts one with looking at their intake sheet, Googling them, and taking down some PDFs information. And then we go and self-evaluate them. So really, we might need to put some here. Like I said, a quotation type. If we put their score. Where would we put their score? I guess we can put that in the notes. Let's see how it works best because I want to just have something fast now. So let's look at the intake sheet. They're Italian. Administrative consultant, administration. So they're a poker player. All right. So what are they ranked? Oh, they've earned some money. Total live earnings and all time when he lists they're like fifteen hundred. All right. So what we would do and I suggest you do this, too. I want push notification is use something like this, like print friendly. And it prints all that off, right, without having all the ads and stuff in there. So, you know, call it a name, name, fold them or poker. But also what we're trying to do is we're just trying to find the information on this person. So it looks like, They need it, so they need a petitioner right so so far, they said they need a petitioner so on that sheet over here, we would say yes, they do need a petitioner when we go back to it like. Where they at this one. context that is petitioner service, you say yes. All right, the other thing they said that they're a business consultant. All right, so then we'll look them up on Google and see what we can find. Sometimes it's even better to just look up their email address and see what that brings up to. So look at their name and their email address, nothing comes up. So then let's put in his full name and then see. All right, so that doesn't seem like we have a whole bunch of stuff on here other than poker stuff, right? There's nothing else like really on them besides what we could see in their poker rankings. Oh, where'd they go? let's say for example um we found more information about them then well this looks like to be different their national rank so they're ranked like ten thousand all-time money so we can take this too because this is different the global poker index um print download as pdf uh so in short just like what I did last week I just have to find uh information as much as I can and then you know do the evaluation yep you do the evaluation and then um The question I kind of have is, like, what to do, like, once we have the evaluation, like, where's the best place to put that? Like, ideally, there would be a place that just says score. And I'm about to, like, do that. Like, I'm about to just put that there. So there should be another column. Yeah. All right, so let's go back. And you mentioned that it should be thirty-five percent. You can run them for both. So you can put like, okay, I'll just show you. Since we're here, let's do it. Because ideally, maybe if they're a sports person, we get it for both. But LegalBridge just put in some new kind of information, but I don't even know how to use it here. Oops. I should really buy that. We must be expensive because it was me. If I had legal bridge day, AI would also buy legal bridge.com. They didn't do that yet. Right. So, oh, we didn't evaluate them yet. Did we? So let's do that part first. That's important. All right, so like those two. So we could do it for both O-one-A and P-one. Or maybe, or is it okay if I'm going to put unsure since this evaluation will still provide the best visa application, right, type of visa? Or do I still need to run O-one-N? I still do both. I'll do both because they don't necessarily know. They're not perfect. Okay. Sure, sure. Oh, we could also put his intake sheet in there. That's important. So download his intake sheet. um regardless of the percentage uh they still need to check this before I do send uh emails and contact them by phone or yeah I mean if you look you'll get better at this right so if you can tell somebody's good yeah to do all this then it's fine and say okay they're good but like if we don't know then that's one place to put it there and then go you know email them and so if they're not good generally you'll be like okay you need to schedule a paid conversation if we know that they're not good Okay, so it's evaluating. But back here, I want to go look into. We might have a problem. Oh, I'm in the wrong bridge. Okay. I need to do firm login. That's like, oh, maybe they kicked me out. All right, so we're here. So you know we go to Dashboard, Admin. I think it's Leads. So it's like we can export their stuff. So he got twenty-five percent on an O-one right here. Right, so I'm not really interested in the documents and stuff like that used yet, because we always can go get that later. I wonder what you do with the API access. So then let's go run it with reset, and we'll run it with P one. Is there a P one here? Yes, I think you have. There you go. So we know it's twenty-five percent on O-one, twenty-five percent on, well, we don't know. We're about to get this in. But I wonder what we can do with this API. I need to do something with that. Okay, I wonder if it like comes up here quicker. So let's press the refresh button. No, still not done. Interesting. Yeah, but basically you would do that and then you would put their score over here. So let's say O one, twenty-five percent, P one, Is it going to tell us? It looks like it's, oh, there we go. Thirty. Thirty. Thirty percent. And then, like, you can, like, in this thing, so we're going to get to the point where you can say, like, hey, you have really high international rankings, but we would need you to get a statement from the sport and all that, right? So you can be like, oh, we need to see if you have some more articles about you. significant awards but we'll get into that later in the next training I just wanted to get past this part first so then we go here and put on p one thirty percent and that's enough for now all right so I gotta hop on another call but we'll save this here and we'll come back to it I will give you these videos um so you can review them but yeah oh uh let's log in to the uh google voice so I'm gonna I'm gonna end this and we'll get you into google voice and we'll leave it there All right? Yeah, sure, sure. Thank you so much.",,,,,

This is attorney Sherrod Seward and Joshua here for module three of the intake lead training. And this one, we're going to be talking about the tools that we have to address the clients. Because what we need them to do is, you know, of course, sign up for services, pay us and sign engagement letters, thing of that nature. For innovative global talent agency, this one is very simple. to send somebody an invoice for petitioner service. Like they're just getting the petitioner service and it looks like this. Oh, I'm on the wrong screen. It's innovative global talent. And then you just put two thousand because that's what it costs. And that's it. That's just for the petitioner service initiation fee. That's how you do it. That gets it right there. Okay. Now, if it's something to where we're sending them a different type of link for some reason, we'll deal with that later. But for now, we're just trying to get the basics. So if it's petitioner service is two thousand, that's the link that you use. Okay. Now, if you if we're charging people for GLF, there's two ways to do it. Or if they're doing sharing sports visas. So I'll show you both. You go sharing sports visas. And if they're asking you questions about filing fees, you go like P-one, eight thousand. Right now, in general, we're charging eighteen. I mean, eight thousand for P-one visas and then like ten thousand for O-ones is the general price that we start at. Right. And then when they go here, Let's see, generally you're gonna wanna use a GLF though because the payment options are already there. But I'm just letting you know that both are here. So if you're talking to somebody and they're confused about the brands and they're just like, hey, I wanna see pricing. I'd like to show them this one because they don't need a password to get in and there's also no way for them to pay. Right, so if we're just quoting them, maybe use shared sports visas, and then you just put the type of visa and the amount. So P-Ones, you always usually start with eight thousand, and for O-Ones, ten thousand. For EV-A, ten thousand, too. I'm just making sure that they all work. Yeah, so you see they all work, right? And you get this nice video here. Now, if it's somebody that like is like they're ready to go, you can send them one from Gill attorneys, the same type of thing. And I'll have the engagement letter and the invoice to pay there. OK, so we'll do P one eight thousand. Now you're going to get something that comes up that says it needs a password. The password for all of them are congrats with a capital C. so when you put congrats it goes into the portal and it looks nice right here you get the video explaining the different options and you can pay your legal fee and engagement letters okay I just want to make sure you understood it uh I understood it so for first year road sports visas uh it's just for them to review the information but they did not have the option to make the p that's correct ready to make the payment they just have to use this one okay yeah yeah unless you see somebody and they're not a sports person then you'll just send them straight to gill attorneys but if it's they're a sports person they likely came through shared sports visas website so we like to keep that branding consistent when they first look at the information to see if they want to move forward and then after that that's where we're like okay you know gill attorneys is the technical name of the law firm and this is where you can see your engagement letter and pay the legal fee and they're both here so that's easy now You can send links directly for payment, because there's always a situation where people just want to link the pay, they don't want to do this. So you can do that with both the engagement letters and the payment. So the payment links are just the amount by thousands. So you can go Gill Law Firm, Gill Attorneys, seven thousand, you'll get the payment link. Or you can go Gill Attorneys, and they're getting a couple of visas. then you can do like fifteen because they're getting like a oh one and something else okay now if it's something that we don't have something for then we'll just have to get it from you know written or something like that now for engagement letters very similar it's gill attorneys and then uh you'll put the word engagement and then the amount Engagement, you know, ten thousand. Then you get this right filing of whatever visa, stuff like that. So it's actually very simple. And of course, I'm going to use these will only give you access to these recordings so you can always go back to them. And I'm going to download the text from these recordings to make a kind of a sheet, something that we can follow. yeah yeah especially those uh those links though it's available here and uh just one more clarification um the amount in the gill of your uh where they can make the payment and the engagement letter. The default amount is, for example, for P-one is it's eight thousand. So we're going to we can use that link. They just have to use the congrats as password. But if we're going to like it's a different amount, then we're going to give them a different link. Right. That's right. Yeah. So we're charging them more like we're charging them ten thousand. Then it would be P-one. Ten thousand. OK. And then the passwords always congrats because they're basically saying congrats. We think you're a great candidate and we're going from there. Right. Because, like, say somebody calls us and it's in for review, we look them up and like, you know, I make a video that's like, hey, here's a you're a great candidate. This is why. Or you talk to them and say you're a great candidate. This is why. then you say okay great congrats we think you're a great candidate um here's the link that you can get the details on filing fees and options for you boom and then we send that and then in your notes you would say like hey they've been sent uh they've been sent an invoice or you would already just cc admin at kill attorneys so they would know and then on the next day that should be on the sheet and what we're trying to do is make sure that everybody one is they're contacted within the first twenty four hours of contacting us. And the other is that they're hit up every week as a follow up until they say, you know, they're not interested. Right. And we're just answering their questions like we did last time. Like, OK, what about this? What about this? And then you're contacting like, you know, me and Wayne will make a new chat group that has that. Maybe I'll do that right now. Spaces. I'll do that later. So I need to make a spaces. All right. So I think right now that's where we'll keep it at. So you can digest this information, go file, find your previous templates that you used. And I know that you need access to what, what a, What account are you trying to log into for the Google Voice? I believe it's Joshua at Sherrod Sparks Visas or Joshua at InnovativeGlobalTalent.com, something like that. No, yeah, see, that doesn't work. So let's try to get you logged in now. I'm going to stop this video here and just leave these. I just have one more clarification. No problem. So when Pamela put the leads on the GLF sheet, then of course, as you mentioned earlier, the default status would be in review, for review, since no one has touched the lead status. yeah yeah now uh am I gonna do the research for that specific um yeah we'll do that we'll do a video about that next yeah we'll do a video next next yeah so I'll stop this one we'll do that one real quick it's quick and we'll go from there",,,,,
Feb.19.2025,GLF and IGTA - Intake Scheduling - Module 2 - where do the leads go,Training Video,GLF and IGTA - Intake Scheduling - Module 2 - where do the leads go,GLF and IGTA - Intake Scheduling - Module 2 - where do the leads go.mp4,GLF and IGTA - Intake Scheduling - Module 2 - where do the leads go.mp3,"All right, we're back and we're on module two. And now we're talking about where do the leads go after they contact us? How do they get to somewhere where we can do something about it? Well, one is some of them come in and then you're immediately able to see something. So if you see a Smith AI or you see like an email direct to us that looks like a good lead, and we know if something's a good lead by looking up the information and seeing if there's something on them you know like if they look like they actually have some accolades then maybe we'll call them right back but um there's one main price where the lead should always be held and updated and that's why it's going to be very important for pamela to keep doing this part right so go to guild attorneys backslash communications This is where the leads are held. And the way that they get here is Pamela puts them on, on this list, but she puts them on the next day. If that makes sense, unless she just happens to be working, but I generally expect for this list to be updated the day after, um, stuff is here. Right. So let's go over what it means to be here. Good. Meaning Pamela is the one responsible in putting those leads in this sheet, right? That's correct. She's the main one responsible for putting it here. But if you happen to talk to somebody, there are certain parts of this that you can put in. So like if somebody calls on Smith and you call them right back, you can kind of just put their name here, you know, just put the stuff that, you know, that you can, since you're already to it. Um, and then go from here for review. This means that, well, let's go on tab. Let's do this in order. Current clients. These are people we do not generally have to touch this one. Right. Unless we're trying to get them to do, um, you know, something else like we've got trying to get them to buy. a different type of product. Okay. I was just gonna look at that. All right. Then, GLF is the, this is the ones that are for Gill Law Firm. Sometimes you might find somebody that will go and be changed to IGTA opportunity, because, you know, maybe I want to do a visa for them for free, or something else has happened, like maybe they can't pay, so I'm doing a deal with them. If that's the case, somebody might be taken off of GLF and just go to IGTA, unless they're just using IGTA for a petitioner service, which is what we really want. We want somebody to pay for Gill Law Firm to do a visa, and then IGTA will serve as their petitioner, if that makes sense. You remember what a petitioner is and everything, right? So renewal opportunities. This is where we're looking at people that have visas that are expiring within the next year or they already have expired and might need another one. This is something that we're going to look at automating. But, you know, you can always just kind of hit them up. Now, see, this one, they should be off the list because they're our current client. They don't need a visa right now. So we can delete that row. OK. But that's what this one is. So they say do not contact, you know, you don't contact them. But if you just go through this and you'll get like an email template, you can kind of say like, hey, your visa is expiring. What are you looking to do with that? Right. Because he's firing in a month, stuff like that. There's a lot of people that are expiring. Mm hmm. Yeah. And I'm going to be working on this one on this sheet as well. Yeah, you're going to be working on this sheet. Yeah, yeah. So these sheets you'll be working on. And I'm just going over the tabs now. So updated renewal opportunity. Let's see. I'm not sure what this one is. Oh, sorry. Just to clarify, on this tab for renewal opportunity, the task will only be about... sending emails and reminding them about the visa. Okay, got it. Yeah. And I think the one you want to use is this one. Yeah, I think we want to use this updated one rather than the new one. Oh, the updated one. Okay. Yeah, the updated one. One thing we need to do is ask Brittany, what is the difference between the two renewal sheets? So let me put a message there. make message about what is okay. Next, let's go back to it. So the other tab that we have is there should be an IGTA tab. So this is ones that we are looking at for possible inclusion for the petitioner sheet. But we're going to redo that. You see all these people on here? This is because a lot of this has automatically been put on here by Zapier, right? So I'm going to go clean this and make it for people that are through IGTA. Yeah. So this one's going to get cleaned out a little bit, but this will be for people that are either just clients at the petitioner service or there are people that we're doing visas for on a reduced basis or something like that. Okay. Okay. So right now, you don't have to pay as much attention to the IGTA until I go through it. but manually you'll be doing the GLF for that. But if they want a petitioner service, you can merge it on here. But I need to go and clean this. I need to clean this list, because there's just a lot of stuff on there. Like I think a lot of this, I can just start a new one, honestly, straight up. All right, then what's this? Communications. This one, I don't think we need to look at it. Yeah, so this one doesn't really mean anything to us. Okay. So I don't know why that's there. Yeah, so but mainly we're looking at those tabs that I said. Now, this is the most important one, GLF. And I'm going to go through kind of like each one that goes in. So this is obvious first name, last name, full name. Right. So status status for review means nobody has looked into their situation to go see if they're a good candidate or not. Right. So they haven't been evaluated. So me to say when, uh, Pamela put the names here, uh, she'll automatically put the status for review. Yeah, they are. That's the main one. It starts as for review and not do anything. So what should happen from there is like somebody actually just kind of does the review, which is something that we'll look at in the next one about how to qualify clients. That'll be the next one. And communication means like we emailed them and they emailed us back. Request for follow-up means like we owe them some information. If somebody is a current client, usually they wouldn't be on here unless they still owe us some money. So if they still owe some money, then they should be here. Right. And then honestly, the ones that aren't good candidates, we might look into like kind of taking these off the list, maybe, but for now we'll keep them there. Email is pretty straightforward. What that means, phone number straightforward, intake form. So this is also something that Pamela's doing to where she's putting like, the intake form that they used. Or you can do data extractions. Summarize this file. Ah, that's new AI stuff in here. Yeah. But this could also be like a Wufoo form or even, because we still do get some Wufoo forms. So that's another place to look, like it's every day, still go to Wufoo. So you'll want to go to Wufoo Hubspace. And then like, you know, just to make sure there's nothing there that came in. And if it did, you can, you can, um, make PDFs of whatever was said there, and then just send that to admin at Gill attorneys. So you can see, so they can see, and it can get on the sheet. So I'll mark that down to give you access to Wufoo and HubSpot. So you can see those, uh, intakes that come in. Um, I'll give you an example. Um, but also, uh, Pamela is checking Wufoo. She's not. It's not OK. Yeah, that would be you for that one. I'll take this password, sorry. Date created, date modified, recent entries. I just like to go to recent entries so you can see the last one that came in. Pre-visa evaluation. So nothing like really new came in. These right here, if there's like attorney collaboration, you don't need to put those, you don't need to put those in because those aren't like clients trying to hit us up. That's just something we're doing with another attorney. So like, you know, if you see a candidate evaluation or a free evaluation like that, that's what you would put in there. So that one doesn't look like anything's going on. Okay. We're on HubSpot. HubSpot, I'll generally make it so that if we get a submission form, it'll automatically go to a place you can see it. So it's not like you have to really log in. OK. All right, so we'll just do that. Don't worry about logging into Squarespace. I will make it so it filters to you. OK, thank you. All right, so one thing I said, here it is, wufoologin. HubSpot. Make it so filter that Josh can see it. So you'll actually see those before Pamela and then like I'll train you to see it saying like, you know, because some of them go to GLF and some of them don't. So that's why it's filtered before you send it to admin. But I'll teach you to know which ones to send there. But for now, just make a PDF of the WUFUs and the stuff that come in. Send it to me first. Remind me to make decisions on which ones go where. And then we'll do that. And the ones that go to Gil, you'll just send to admin at gilattorneys.com. And then Pamela should be able to get on there. OK. So I'm not going to put it on the sheet directly. I have to let you know first. if it's approved then I'll send it to you to admin and pamela will be able to see it and put it on the correct okay got it now all right so I think for where the leads come from this and when you do that send that email to um pamela you just make sure that you you send admin at gill attorneys all right okay so that's how these get here then folder you already know what that is she's using that email right at admin yeah that's our okay send consultation email call so contact status we'll probably change this so this is good so quotation visa type this is where you put on what visa they're being quoted for like so it might be o one p one whatever stuff like that right and this will put in the amount this is the dollar amount of what they were what they were quoted, okay? Now, when you make a communication with them, you go to this, so you can put in the dates of what they were contacted by and stuff like that. And then you'll go here and make some updates to what they were said, like, you know, whatever they said. So this is where you can kind of just copy and paste the notes so we can follow up on what was done with that. So we need to get requested. OK, so we need we need to be able to edit that. So we need to be able to edit all of these updates unless. Yes, we want that, but then also Pamela should be doing that too. So I'm gonna put a note about that as well. So that's either one can update that, but we want to be able to do that to make sure it gets done. Make sure the update docs are anyone can edit. But. Pamela needs to be sure to update each one if not done. OK. now my my question uh sherrod uh am I gonna be am I gonna be working uh on those uh leads with the in communication status because there's already someone working on it or am I gonna be working on those leads with a review status only yeah yeah so these ones These ones should be generally this first status is what Pamela is doing. Yeah. Generally, unless it's something that, you know, it came up and we know it's wrong. Contact status is barely where you'll be doing. You'll be like, okay, I emailed and called them and then put in the correct date, the visa type and the quotation amount. All right. Now, if they need a petitioner, that's where you'll say, you know, the current client or whatever. So they need They need a petitioner service, say yes. If they don't, put no. If you happen to talk to them but they're not sure, you can put I don't know or just leave it blank, right? And then if you click yes, what we need is for a Zapier, they'll automatically be placed on the IGTA list. If it's yes, they need a petitioner service. So I'm going to put a note to make sure that Zap is correct. Meaning, what do you mean? Will it automatically move to IGTA sheet? Yeah, yeah. Like I want it so that if this is clicked yes, it'll automatically go over here. Like you won't have to do it yourself. It'll automatically go over here. All right. Let's go back. And then, so that's interested in petitioner service and is that the last one, I think that is the last bit of information lead style stream yard okay. lead type I don't think we put anything there stream yard that's what I do so if I are you can do it too is like if I make a video for somebody that goes in here like there'll be a stream yard link that would just go in here. And the reason we put it there is that there is an automatic email that goes like once a week or every eight days if that happened to make a video for them. And there's also an automated email that just says follow up. Do you have any questions that send every ten days? But that's not something you have to do physically. That can happen automatically. Unless I'm like, I record some videos and I say, Hey, Joshua, make sure you, you know, send these videos to these people, text it to them. But then you'll also want to put those links in here. So that way, if they don't look at it, it will be sent to them the next week. Does that make sense? Yeah. And again, sorry, I have to go back to those leads with communication status. I just really have to make sure that I understood it. Do I need to touch them? Because I mean, there's already someone working on this leads. So I don't know who I need the contact to make sure. Yeah. So this will be like this status when we're in the front and it says status, that should be Pamela. That's doing the admin. And you contact her through admin at Gill Attorneys. Now, over here, contact status, this will be you. Because you're saying like, okay, I emailed them. I called them. And then you'll put the quotation type, you know, latest amount and stuff like that. Um, now if you call somebody and you like have some different, like you send them an email, you also copy admin at Gill attorneys. So that way Pamela can see it. And then that will get put on the next updates. Right. So I don't really want you to have to do these updates here. What should happen is when you email or call somebody and make a note and send it to admin at Gill attorneys, Pamela should put it on there. Right. So you don't have to do that. Does that make sense? We're clear. Yeah. All right. So I think that is good enough for this portion of it. Now we'll look at kind of like automation. So how do we manage the leads next? So I'm going to stop this video and then we'll go to the next module. Sounds good? Yeah. All right. I forgot how I'm going to do that. That should be this. Uh-oh. Is this stuck? It is stuck. All right, there we go.",,,,,

This is Attorney Sherrod and Joshua, and we're going into the new lead program that we're going to have for GLF and IGTA. And this particular part of the program is just seeing where the leads all come from as it stands currently. We do have plans to change this over the next two weeks to get it more streamlined, but this is what we have to work with. And so that's what we'll use and do our best with that. With that being said, we're going to look at the three places where we get leads, the websites. But then you also got to keep in mind there's like WhatsApp and things like that. But we're just going to focus on these three websites and see where the leads come from so we can keep it moving. That being said, our screen is already shared. Let's go into it. So Sharon's Sports Visas is where a lot of the leads originally come from. And the way they can contact us is by, they can do a call, which will submit a Smith AI call. They can do this, which will initiate a HubSpot form for now, but that will probably be changed soon. And then that sends an email to us. They could use this chat bot right here, which is branded with Gil. This also issues a Smith AI call. will email to us. And then if they can find an email address, like they'll just email us directly. And so those are the ways that they can call us on shared sports visas and contact us. All right. Now there might be pages that are old that might submit something like Wufoo. For example, I think if somebody goes like this and they just happen to have an old link, That will initiate. Let's see where this goes. I'm thinking it's probably going to be a Wufoo form. Oh, so no, that goes to the Gill attorneys. All right. So that goes to let's get started. The reason I don't like this is because we don't get these like right away. When these come, they go somewhere in the back end of Gill. And that's what there needs to be changed. When somebody fills this out, we need to see it so we can do something about it right away instead of waiting for the next day. All right. So that's this website. So then the next one is Innovative Global Talent Agency. So people can contact us now. That probably goes to a Squarespace form. People can there is a phone number here. I'm not sure whose phone that rings, honestly. But very soon there's going to be an AI bot that's going to answer that and then fill out a form too. And then, of course, they can email info at Innovative Global Talent Agency. So there's no chat bot on here yet. So that's what that one does. So that's pretty straightforward. Now, Gill Law Firm, Let's see what happens when you put let's talk. So when you get let's talk, you get this form here, which I think is not good because what if they don't know what type of visa they want? This might be asking too much information up front. Ideally, this should go to something that's more like this, something like really short or even better yet, When you go to Shared Sports Visas and you click, you know, get started, it only asks you like this information first, I don't know. And then it will go to another form that is longer, right? Which I think is a better user experience than filling out all this, especially if it doesn't have an other, they don't know what they need, right? If list awards and all that type of stuff, that's not a good idea. It needs to go capture information and then ask them that. So that's one thing that we need to approach the Gill Law Firm with is to make it so there is a step in between that. And it's something that we can do really quickly. For example, we could just have this form recreated, put Gill Law Firm on there. and then have this go to this sheet after that, which I think is probably what's going to happen. We're going to get on HubSpot, ask them for some more days, and then have a Gill Law Firm version of this that will then go to that. All right. Let's see what other type of information that they have. Let's talk. So that still goes to the welcome. Okay. got some success stories there their website's looking much better isn't it so here's this thing where does this phone number go like this shouldn't be here like this this this has to be gone because we don't know what's going on with the lead if they if it just goes to um wayne and there's no way for us to see what happened and went in there then we also need to call this number and see where it goes because I'm not sure where that goes. But if that goes directly to somebody without it being documented, we won't be able to tell what's going on there. So I'm going to put that in some notes. All right. So that's where the leads can come in. And one thing we know is that we can't see. So this should be Smith AI. Oh yeah, look at this too. This goes into a back end testing. Where does this go? I think this is within weeks. So let's see if that's immediately. available to us. So, so far, it looks like that wasn't, that didn't send it. Oh, there it is. Is that what that is? Descript. Wait. No, that's something else. That's how to make video powered AI. Try it free on ChatGPT. I might look into that. I think that's a different one, yeah. Yes, I'm different. All right, so let's mark what we have going on here with, so this, so the first thing was there should be, one, there needs to be just contact form before that launch. Tough spot can do that. Then these below, these below need to be changed so it can be funneled unless Wayne sends those to admin. All right. we need to see where this number goes so basically I'm saying if he doesn't send an email to somewhere where it'll be placed on that lead sheet we won't know about it where does this number go okay so that's where leads all come in from besides something to like where uh something might come in on whatsapp or google voice or something like that and that's what we're going to get into the next video is like what happens when there is a lead how do they eventually get to somewhere we can see them or they need to right Okay, so I'll do that next. Did you have any questions about how the leads come in? No, I'm all good. All right, so I'm going to stop this video and we're going to go on to the next one.",,,,,
Feb.07.2025,IGTA Recording Ankit - O2 Visas - Samp army,Business Development or Marketing,IGTA Recording Ankit - O2 Visas - Samp army,IGTA Recording Ankit - O2 Visas - Samp army.mp4,IGTA Recording Ankit - O2 Visas - Samp army.mp3,"Alright, we're back and we're getting ready to talk about O-II visas. I'm going to share a different screen. All right. We're getting ready to go to O-two visas. Now, this is what I kind of want to talk about. So on January twenty third, I said, add these documents to an O-two folder with these two. And find what you can on the Internet. He said, OK. Now. So what's these people's names? Chirag and Kumon. I don't see them on the case sheet. Did this ever happen? Can you see? I can't see properly. All right. So look, watch. On the twenty-third, it's like add these documents to O-two folder and see what you can about these persons and add to research, right? You say you got it, but on the case sheet, these people are nowhere to be found. Is there a folder with the information on these two somewhere? No, there is no folder, actually. I guess I missed it. Like, I must be in something else, so that's it. All right. But so now it's like a thing like what we're at now. Hopefully there's not anything else that's not not been leaving, you know. So from today forward, we got to be tight when I'm doing this. I'm expecting it to end on this sheet somewhere. Right. The same with the people I've mentioned, Adrian. visa application. So, oh, it was an hour ago, he's hitting you up. You know, that's a person. Adrian should be over here and he should be getting responded to. The other person I mentioned, his son is using this for his petitioner service. So I'ma forward this to you so like his information should get on Gil's. And there's a guy named Aguian. Did he get this message? Tell him since it's Gil Law, they have already filled out the information for us. Did you send him this? I guess I am. Let me check. I remember I sent this to someone. Let me check. You see what I'm saying? Him and Dusan should be over here. That's the Lee guy. All right, let me see if I can get you a whole. So now let's get into the actual O-two petition. O-twos, you do the forms. Let me see if I can get a complete one. Let me check on something. Wait, pause it. What I'm doing now is I'm trying to find you a full file of a O-two version. So O-twos are similar to O-ones, except for there might be multiple people. So you fill out form I-. But instead of saying an individual, Well, you can name one individual, but sometimes they'll say give a name or just say how many beneficiaries are going to be there. You can just say two for this case. There's going to be two visas on the same package. I'm sure I had a whole one. To to to to. Say complete. It's got a PDF. We have his approval notices. Oh, here we go. So I want to be. And this one, there's no option to do this. Okay, here we go. Partial exhibits. Staff, partial exhibits. So as you see, we got the passports. on other forms. All right. Well, and anyway, you do the I one twenty nine forms, but where it says, do they have a name of a beneficiary? Instead of doing that, you put two and then you'll put when it asks about the passport information and all that of the benefit, you'll put the first one and then you'll do I one twenty nine form a supplement. So like this. And this is what you do for each person that's additional. I gotta find it. I'll just pull up a form and show you. All right, so the petitioner is the same, right? Then you write O-two here. This one is like O-two. You'll do new employment. You'll notify a consulate. You'll put none here. The total number is the total number of beneficiaries you're going for, and this one will be two. Then you put named. As a beneficiary requested or named. So then you put the first person's name and go through regular with all this stuff right here, right? And then you'll put the console there. The first person will, you know, this time we'll put Abu Dhabi. So for each of them, put Abu Dhabi. Well, like for this, you just put Abu Dhabi since it's only one form. All right, now the difference is once you go through all of that, you see this attachment one? Oh wait, let's see where to start. Alright, so on page thirty seven it says attachment one attached to form I- one twenty nine when more than one person. So for the second person you fill out this form. For them. Alright, so one person you'll do as regular and then the second person you add this. The other things that need to go into an O-two petition is the approval notice. The approval notice of O-one. Yep. So this one's going to be Shaji. All right. So I'm going to space it off of this one. So that's there. I've sent you to passports. I also sent you an email that has some PDFs because you got to kind of prove that these guys have things about them. So I want you to do is look at the, like convert these to a PDF. Yeah. They convert them to a PDF and then also I wonder if these can be. Translated in chat GPT. Because if you actually need translations would be nice if they were actually on on the Internet somehow. I looked that up in a second. Think if I go to. On high. Can you translate this? All right, so I'm just seeing if it can translate this automatically. I don't know. While it's doing that, it might take a little bit. I am going to see, because I saw one that was like in English, Western Times. Sharag Patel. That's another way we could just like look at it like that, Sharag. Is that him? I don't think that is him. Oh, maybe that is him. Well, basically, is that him? I'm gonna save this just in case. And if you haven't, I had mentioned this to get this friendly thing. And when I say that, it doesn't work. Why did my screen just go blank? Something's happening. I saw this. Oh, maybe because I'm clicking on stuff. This is probably ruining my computer. Anyway. So you don't say so. Go look on the Internet and try to find what you can from them. Let's see if that was able to. Oh wow. So you can go into chat GPT, translate all those and include it with what's going there. So do that for both of them. And then I'll give you the order of the way the O-two should go. And then you can take a shot at using the template to make one happen. This particular one's going pretty slow. I think I'm going to close this window out and go to the other computer to do it. Yeah. I think this stuff is like messing up here. Let's say for that. Alright. Looks like we might be good to go. Oh. Goodbye seconds. Alright. So here is template to use for the. Support letter. It's the same petitioner, so the petitioner stamp army. And you'll do it without an attorney of record, so we're still doing it as Samp Army is doing it for themselves, so don't include an attorney of record. I will get you some previous forms so you can see the petitioner information for them. Let me see if I can do that over here. This one, oh, okay. These ones seem to have forms. And I will need one complete package as well, so I will try to make a full complete package on this weekend. All right. This is. So as an example, this is an example of a complete package. Remember, no attorney of record. Oh, I can just give this to you, I think. There are no G-twenty eight. All right. What was I not pasting? sample file. Okay. So it says order of documents. So you got, um, credit card form. Um, I have one, I want a nine a or each additional person. Then you have, um, Approval notice of principle. Um? There's any other improvement exports. I'll let you know. Is he have brief? Support letter. Proven notice of principal passports, evidence of . Evidence about the petitioner. Skill set. Then you got evidence of . future events. So this one, you know, you look up the information about Samp Army and U.S. T-ten. So you look up Samp Army, U.S. T-ten. And what's the name of their management company? I think it's called T-ten. Try cricket. T-ten. So like all this T-ten stuff, you can grab stuff about that. Don't get stuff about like this. Yeah, it's bad. Like, you know. Oh, definitely get this. So this one where he's talking, I'm gonna grab that because he's talking about being in the US. So we're basically saying that these people are supporting Shaji El Mouk. Wait a minute, what was that? So I'm just grabbing this as an example of some evidence that you could use. But I saw something that caught my attention. Sorry, the computer is fighting me a bit. Let me see if I can open this in a different one. All right, I'm going to switch the screens I'm sharing. Can you see the doc now? Yeah. Oh, no. That's not what I wanted. So US Masters, T-Ten, Shaji. Right. American sports. Yeah. So you want to get the information about T-ten being in. In America. Now, I saw something about my. Let's see if I can, okay. Octagon's cricket division. That's what I need. I need to know what that is. So I didn't know Octagon had a cricket division. All right, anyway. So evidence of each person's skill set and working together, evidence of future events, and then you're done. Oh, yeah. Then there'll be like a support letter from Shaji and a support letter from Ritesh. And I'll show you where these are. So looking through this, actually, I'll make you a clone one. I'll make a copy. Make a copy so you can use this one instead. OK. So support staff for the primary visa holder, you know, you'll put Shaji El Mouk. Then this one, I mean, I guess you can leave that the same. Take sure you're acting as, this one will be direct employer. So like these will be direct employer. So please, Shaji. Oh, Luke. All right, so that one I'm doing for you. OK, they got that petitioner status that we can you can skip this status of the principal visa holder. That means we provided the. Approval notice and everything. Yeah. This is not an athlete, so we got to change that. Okay, so this one, you'll put stuff about Shaji al-Muq. This is where you'll make arguments to say like why they're needed in the United States. I guess we can ask the United States Cricket Board. Who's on the Cricket Board? USA Cricket Board. So here, I'm just going to request one like real quick. Say like a. Hello. We would. Like to request. Go to consultation letters. For Sherrod. Hotel and what's the other gentleman's name? Do you have it in front of you? His name is a little bit more difficult to me. Mayor Kumar. Right? So we send that. Then we make a PDF. Okay. Was I messing with the wrong one? Is this the one I've been editing? Damn. Yeah, this is awesome. Oh my gosh. Messing up to this. No worries. Let me make this a copy. So you can edit this one directly. Okay, I think it automatically updated. Actually, I'm not sure. So I'm just going to erase, put it back. Make that the template. Wait, what is this one? How many of these do I have open? Well, that one doesn't have an X. I need the one that has an X. At this one. This one has text. Alright, so. Alright. OK. This is copy. Now we're back in status. So you'll fill that in. Make that about Sharjah MOOC. contributions. You'll show why it's important to have people from India that actually know cricket to come here. They have a lot of rapport together, you know, basically saying that they've been working together. And then we'll say we did request a consultation letter from U.S. Yep. We requested a consultation letter. Better from USA. Alright, so then you'll fill this out about the. The people. And then you put, you know, information that you can find about each each person here. This time you only have two. And you can kind of. you know, kind of make stuff up. Don't be like, you know, too crazy with it. And then that's the end of that part of the petition. Right? Then you have a letter from Samp Army. That'll be from Ritesh. So you change this to say he's been helping Shaji, you know, and kind of switch this language up. Or is that, let me see. This is from, yeah, this will be from Ritesh. And this will be from Shaji. Right. So the first one is from Ritesh. This was from Shaji. And then this is the contract. So you put the beneficiaries names and kind of just like fill this part out and then you'll be pretty good to go. Do you have any questions about that? No, no. right so that's all we have for uh training today um thank you for your patience on that I will I'll play the outro now and then um send you the email with these documents and the video and then like a text from it so you can have the instructions sure thanks so much",,x,x,,
Jan.08.2025,Deep Tech Discussion regarding O-1 Visas for Tech Entreprenuers,Business Development or Marketing,Deep Tech Discussion regarding O-1 Visas for Tech Entreprenuers,Deep Tech Discussion regarding O-1 Visas for Tech Entreprenuers.mp4,Deep Tech Discussion regarding O-1 Visas for Tech Entreprenuers.mp3,"Okay. We're good to go. So I understand deep tech community is looking for immigration help and trying to determine what side is the best. Um, the thing is every situation is unique. What we specialize in is not only O one visas, but we do it in structures that are really beneficial towards founders. And we learned this by dealing with some of the best athletes in the world, for example, a lot of cricket players, a lot of boxers to where they work for multiple places, but they also run multiple businesses. We make that happen all on the same visa. And that's something we do on sports. Now, in the tech community, there's a lot of misinformation and just wrong information out there. For example, I just had a blockchain person call me and say that, I think it was legal pad or deal. One of them, there's legal pad deal Plymouth that do a lot of the tech stuff and they mess things up when this, they charge them twice for a one visa. And it's taken like six months for them to get their draft out, which is crazy. Right. So what we do is we serve as a petitioner, but we also do not take six months to get visas out since we are kind of a small shop, but a dedicated shop. And what was presented to me was, hey, why don't you pay us ten thousand a month to be come and speak or something like that? I'm like, hey, you can make more than that just serving as a petitioner. And I'll show you what that means. I'm going to share my screen. Sure. You have any questions so far? No, but now I'm good. All right. I'm sorry, I didn't even wish you a happy new year. I have been sick and blank in my mind. Happy new year, first of all. Happy new year. We went right into the business, but I think it's never too late to wish something good. You know what? You're right. You're absolutely right. I guess I just kind of hopped into it too. All right. So that's my back end. Let me get to the front end. So we'll start at the basics. What is a petitioner? Usually, it's the company that's hiring the person to work. So I'm an AI engineer. Google hires me. They serve as a petitioner employer. Now, the problem comes in is when you want to be your own company. Google is not going to let you freelance on your own with their visa, whether it be H-B or O-B. What we do is the petitioner can file for the O one and make it so they can work for Google and also do their freelance activities and maybe even work for somebody else all on one. Right. We typically charge at least two thousand dollars to do that. What I was suggesting is that deep, deep, deep your organization can do that instead of us. You can serve as the petitioner. hold the visa for the people in your community and then charge them for that service you can charge them monthly or you can charge them up front but you know that they'll have to pay because you'll actually hold on to their visa and why they want you to do that is because if you're not involved in their um employment negotiations or contract negotiations they know that you won't hold that over their heads So they know for three years, their O-one visa will be parked somewhere with an organization they trust that will not revoke it or use it as leverage over them. And that gives them the freedom for a couple of things. One, it frees them from being tied to one employer that holds the visa validity over their head, but it also allows them to keep full control of their business. Say this, if you apply for an O-one visa on your own business, you have to give up either fifty one percent control or have a board that can fire you that's the same thing if you do an h-one b for your own business there automatically there has to be some type of entity that has control on whether or not you can still work there even though it's your own business so if deep think serves as a petitioner Then they can go work for multiple employers and their visa will still be fine if they get fired. And then they can also open up their business or multiple businesses on that same visa. And then DeepThink can charge for that service. We usually charge two thousand upfront or something like three hundred monthly. But you make much more. money from that then like you know do the sponsorships which we don't do like we don't we don't pay for sponsorships what we do is put information out there and um it's just not it's not our business model we don't do heavy marketing we wait for people that understand the sophistication of what we do to appreciate it and do business with us yeah I have a quick question why did you stop being a petitioner then what was the downside to it that you stopped doing it Oh, I still do. What I'm saying is we don't have to. Okay. I forgot. You weren't there on the first meeting. So I'm an immigration attorney myself. And I'm known for this. I'll show you my other websites. This is where I learned immigration law. I've done it for world champion, Olympians, boxers, cricket players, poker players, mind readers, anything... horseshoe makers right but I've all done it on oh one in this structure and I started the petitioner service because they didn't have anyone to service their petitioner so I learned how to do it and then that's why I'm like oh you can do a whole bunch of things that people don't know about just by having a third party service your petitioner so that's why I started doing Innovative Global Talent agency and um I'll show you the other one oops that's the wrong one I'll just go to Gill Attorneys. So now the law firm side is Gill Attorneys. This is where the law is practiced, the immigration attorneys. So IGTI is just a petitioner service. What I am suggesting is that instead of Innovative Global Talent Agency serving as a petitioner, your organization does. Yeah. And then Gill Law Firm. who I work with on the visa side will do the visas and structure it properly the same way they would if I was serving petitioner you know so that is what my proposal is is that deep think become a petitioner service for your constituents and uh charge for that What is the downside to it? Like what it takes to become a petitioner? I understand that it's a company, we are a registered company, we are an Inc, so we have that, but it need to have certain revenue to be a petitioner or what is the thing to it? Okay, I'm gonna show you a couple of things. So there's three things a petitioner, petitioner form. I'm gonna show you how this works. I'm gonna show you the backend, how we make it done. I know I said there's three things, I'm gonna get to it. I just can't type and talk at the same time. I should be able to, I should try it. I wrote down and let me pull those up as well. Would I just do foreign employer? Just give me this. Foreign employer, okay. So then we have multiple employer. Okay, so there's three things a petitioner has to have or assert to be a petitioner. No revenue requirements, nothing. One is you have to assert that the information in the petition is true to the best that you know. It doesn't have to actually be true, but it's just like, from what I know, this stuff is true, okay? Second is you agreed to receive service of process, which means if the beneficiary is sued, they can be done at your address that doesn't mean you have liability it's just that they need some address where to find somebody to sue them right because if somebody's not from the united states they might not even be here so that's the address to where people can sue uh send their lawsuits but it doesn't mean that the petitioner is liable it actually means the petitioner is not live does it make sense yes let me just I think I have a question along that line I did note some down let me pull up my notes just give me a second That's obvious question is like, you are already doing it. So why would you want deep tech community to be in that space? Since we innovation tech company innovation is doing it. So why would you want us to be in that space? Well, it did. So us, we don't mind. Sure, we love it. We make some revenue. But it seemed to me that DeepThink was looking to make revenue because at first we thought we were just competing for, you know, saying like, hey, this is the legal stuff we do. And then it presented us like, hey, pay us like a sponsorship fee. I'm like, oh, man, we really don't do that. But I have an idea for you. If you're looking to raise revenue, we can teach you to serve as a petitioner and you would make. more money than you would do by us paying a sponsorship anyway. So that's how it came up. It's like, you know, we don't mind doing it, but it's just like, hey, you guys can actually make some money if you're looking to raise revenue by doing this. Let me just because actually I was so I have a sister so who is actually filing for her green card and that is through on visa was the first suggestion to us. But the thing downplayed to it was like you have to be tied to a company. And at the time when you are filing it. And if you want to join a new company that should be again, disclosed in your own visa or the petitioner visa. So this is a bit, I'm getting a bit confused there. So, right. So the reason why you'll hear that is because a lot of immigration attorneys don't have the expertise of me actually doing this for years in sports. So a lot of immigration attorneys don't, they have no idea. They don't know they haven't done it. So this is how it works. So like, so for her, if she has an employer, Uh-huh. I'll show you where it is. So the employer would be here, multiple employers. So the employers that she has or that she thinks of, I can get them to fill this out and only ask them this. It says, you know, what's the description of the activities that you want them to do with us? And we'll say something big like it might happen over the course of these years. So she already knows of potential employers. We have them fill this out. Multiple employer form. now if she wants say she has a company overseas or she has um an association with a company overseas or she wants to start her own then we do um oh that's the wrong one um at this one foreign employer put the wrong one in and this is actually very helpful so say if you have a family business if we act as u.s agent for foreign employer we don't even need to get a lot of these multiple employments we can say the foreign employer is directing them to go and do activities with companies and set forth now what you might come into an issue with is there might be some companies that don't understand that you can do this and they might be like no we want you here's the worst case that could happen they'll say we don't like your own visa we want to switch you over People don't know this. You can have two O one visas at the same time. Or you can have that company just amend the current one you have with the petitioner to include them. But that prevents you from being tied to that company based on your visa. So that's how we do that. The companies are included as multiple employers. If you have a foreign company, like a family business, or you have your own business in another country, then you'll use it as foreign employer. And then what we do is this. This is the petitioner agreement. Now, you see this here? How it says direct employment, agent functioning as employer, foreign, all that? This is what we use to show that there'll be a stream of activities in the United States, regardless of what their employer or not. So what we do is like, okay, we look at your profession and say, you're an AI engineer. One thing we always do is we'll put in the contract of things they'll be doing for us. So like, hey, they'll be marketing the talent agency to other people like them. So by there, they have a steady flow the whole time of an activity they'll already be doing. And then we'll say something like, they might be involved with projects for us to build projects we'll do together. Now we might do those projects, we might not, but it gives them an itinerary that's set with a company, us, right? And so that validity date goes and everything else that they put under there is fine to go. And we can say we can direct them to do that. And another thing we do is we kind of do job placement too. If somebody has skill set and we have employers that we like, we are looking around to get subscribed with other employers so that we have a whole bunch of these set. We have a whole bunch of multiple employer agreements that say that they're looking for anybody talent with us that looks like this. Right. So that somebody comes, they say, have AI. We might have ten companies that say we're looking for AI people that are signed with the talent agency. And so that way they can work with any on their current. Oh, one, because we can show you that this was contemplated. Yeah. One question I have, if I become a petitioner, am I liable if the visa is denied as a deep tech community? No. No, there's no liable if they can sue that. So when you do this, you'll still have an engagement with the law firm. So if they really get pissed off, they would go sue the law firm for malpractice. They wouldn't sue Legal Deal. So they would still come with an engagement letter from the law firm for that. But of course, we, you know, it doesn't happen. But the law firm, like, I just say I bring a petition and it goes to a law firm and they should be like, oh, I want to take this case or not. They're going to do the initial filtering. They're going to look at the profile, isn't it? Right. So if you're working with us, by us, I mean Gill Law Firm. Yes, we will filter the cases. Now, this is one thing that we do when we set you up. I'll show you how it looks on mine. is uh like I said we build projects on our own when it comes to ai products and stuff like that so we already have you know and we can set you up with this where it has a um visa evaluation and you can start your own evaluation so we have like this uh you go build a pdf of your your things you know and then you put it through here I'll show you what it looks like I need somebody's like resume though it's uh let's do it it's like asking for their achievements and everything and you're gonna filter based on their case like is it promising or not oh we're gonna right and so that will go back to uh that will go back to us and um And then, so we'll come back to you because that's part of like, so if you partner with us and that means the law firm or the talent agency, either way, we can set you up with this portal. So say deep mind. I mean, sorry, am I saying it right? It's deep think. Deep tech community. Deep tech community. Why did you correct me? Why'd you do that? Okay. I just let it be for the moment. were judging me the whole time I was not judging you because I connected you once and it kept happening so I was like I don't like to make people feel uncomfortable oh that's hard to do with me except for now because you judge me that's fine my fault detect so he has a lot of stuff So I'm working with them now to like where you can submit multiple documents at one time instead of just one because right now you have to make a single PDF. You know, it's a little bit annoying, but, you know, it could be worse. Do, do, do. All right, now one thing is you don't have to select O-one, so if you're unsure, you can put what beats us best. Now here's what this does. So if you come and do this and you're like, You come out better for like an L one or something like that. We will come and let deep tech know. And then it was like, Hey, we don't like to do those. We do know law firms that are good at that, but that's one thing with us. We're not just taking any business. We're taking business in oh one. Oh, one B E B one a, and sometimes EB two and I w like, you know, I'm not about to do an L one. I'm not about to do an E two. I'm not gonna do EB two. Like, I'll tell you like, Hey, it looks like they might be better for this. I'm not going to force it. If you want somebody, because like, I think our John said he wants multiple attorneys anyway. I'd be like, okay, this is an attorney. I know that does good. Oh, here's the other thing to know. There's an O one a and O one B when we can, we always, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear. Okay. When we can, we always put somebody in O-B because then you can get essential support staff. So say if your sister was also like, popular on YouTube or Instagram, on top of being a tech star, a tech beast. We can put her under O-B and then she can get essential support staff, up to twenty at a time. So say she owned a business and she was under O-B, she can get O-Visas for all her staff and we can file on one application. Or if you have uncles and stuff like that, boyfriends, girlfriends, we do all types of stuff with the O-Visa. And that lasts as long as the O-A. All right, so we have Elon Musk right here, but you know, could be good evaluation. So we can set like a portal up like this for deep think. Deep tech community. You are dealing with tech people, deep tech, that's it, deep and tech. I got you. DT. Okay. I get really excited to talk about petitioner services. I get distracted. So it takes a little bit, but we can set up the API to where when they do this, you would get an intake, we would get an intake, and it could be populated into a Google spreadsheet or whatever type of database that you have. I know how to use Zapier a little bit. I know a little bit. So we can figure that out. And then it'll come and give a score. even if the score is low we'll still go and look at it but also tell them like where they're um lacking where they could build their profile into that's correct so obviously you know he's using four percent success rate apparently he hasn't been writing scholarly articles But yeah, you see, so that's one way like that's another service. You can say like, hey, our community, we have this way that you can kind of evaluate and come in. And then one thing we're working on, too, is we're going to make a course to like how to build your profile in case it doesn't, you know, doesn't get up there. We'll have like some type of course soon that'll introduce you to publicist and some strategy ideas to build that profile up. So your agency has even reaches like to publication houses where they could have some connections with or not. Do you help them build a profile or the profile building is entirely on the petition, on the people who actually are filing for the visa? We do. We do. And that's done on like an hourly rate. So it's something like, okay, we'll do a contract where we do a minimum of five hours. This is how much. And then we show them what we're doing. So usually that is done on the hourly rate. So besides serving as a petitioner, the talent agency does do job placement services because we're always trying to sign up more employers to be in our pool. and we uh we don't charge well it kind of depends like so say like if you are in the wheelhouse of something that we are doing already then as we're going we're introducing your profile but if you say that you want to be placed you can play you can pay us uh to us represent you we'll actively go take your profile and really just go shop it to people right But we do have a talent pool to like, okay, if you're included into the talent pool, we don't charge you for that. We just bring employers to look at your profile. And if they like you, they'll let us know. And then we'll let you know. that is only for employers that's for employment regarding I'm talking about like building the profile for the visas oh no yeah right yeah so that's again too so yeah building a profile for visa that's another service that we have too and that's kind of like the same as if we were trying to find them employment or we're just trying to build their profile for a visa that's the same thing we just do it like a consulting fee and then we make that happen we'll talk to the publicist um we'll look up awards that may be good for you um And maybe even give you ideas for publications to submit yourself as a co-author, stuff like that. And then we might say, hey, get in, like, so we know celebrities, right? So we might say like, hey, help us build a use case for the world champion of the UFC. He wants to build a training app that shows how hard somebody's punching, right? So then if you do that, that will help build your profile by working on projects that have a lot of notoriety. Yeah. another question let me like is there any upfront cost like involved for the community to become a petitioner no nope as long as you have a if you have an llc um that's it that's all you need and then um because you guys would be giving us referrals we would come in and build stuff like this like we're not we wouldn't charge you to Build this. Now, here's one thing. We don't own. Legal Bridge owns this. So if there was a cost, they might charge you like a couple hundred a month to have this tool built in. But that's not us. We're not going to charge you that. And then what we would do also is build in your portals. So you have your own foreign employer form and all that. And then the back end so we can manage your. Let me see what a portal looks like. so you'd help us in building this portal and have a service fee for it yep yep so we would help you build this part and then we would help you have your uh document so if we know that we're doing a lot of visas for deep tech we'll have it so we already have the information for you and your forms already built out so it even helps your clients the clients that come through go faster because we have all the information for the petitioner already So this is a cricket league that we set up a portal for. And so, you know, we can build this on our website or your website. So it's like, they'll say deep tech. And have a nice video from me saying, or, you know, somebody. And we can even make it in different languages. So say we can get an AI video. Someone explains what to look for. Here's your options. And then you'll have pricing that's just set for your community. So we'll negotiate a price that's just set for your community. And so they can submit a long intake form. They can do an AI evaluation. They can submit their consular processing information. And then they'll have payment links and letters and stuff, everything all in the portal that's right there. So they can kind of just shop around for what they need. You know, if they want to be like, hey, who have they worked with? They can see our past performance, NBA, one championship. But yeah, but basically we built this on your website that'll have everything there about the pricing, the options to include the candidate forms. And then for you, there's not much... only thing that we wouldn't charge you for anything that we can do on our own but it may be the case that legal bridge ai will want to charge something monthly for access to the evaluations I was talking to them today um because they didn't have this as a standalone product like this is a whole thing we use to build visa packages and uh so he said he would get back to me with the pricing on this because I told him like this is a product on its own right so So now my biggest concern is because with the deep tech community, we get so many requests in our events that, oh, we are looking for some visa sponsorship opportunities, law firms. How can we become a petitioner for multiple people? How is that even possible? How can you become a sponsor for multiple people? The petitioner for multiple people. Oh. Well, there's nothing. How many employees do you have? it's about seven, some are out of the country, some are within the country, but these are not the one we're looking for visa sponsorship. We get involved. Yeah. No, the reason I was asking, because the pricing for, for the filing fees are different if you have over twenty five employees. So there is no minimum or maximum to like the number of visas you can sponsor. Because we're not saying you're the employer. We're saying that you're only serving as the agent for employers. And there's three types of employers, right? We have self-employed, US multiple employer, or foreign employer. But we always make it clear in the petitions that we write that Deep Tech is not the employer. And we don't put you on the hook in a petition for having to pay any money. We might say something like the same thing we do, saying like, hey, people can earn a commission for bringing more people to us, right? But we won't put anything in there that says that you have to pay them a fee for nothing, or like some type of employment. And they won't need that too, because they'll have the self-employment activities in there. And so in the form, I-GBWN-TWENTY-NINE, we'll say, how much are they making for a year? We'll say a hundred thousand. But in the petition, we'll say they'll make at least this based on the total activities that they'll be doing. And it's clear that it's an estimate. And it's something we do all the time. Like, you know, I might I mean, I might have seventy right now. OK, I think I'm not clear with one thing. like say a person like arjun he's uh working with google or microsoft that he is currently working with and I am a deep tech community where he is involved with in terms of like our communities about like promoting those people researchers founders connecting with bc this is what our platform is mainly about so when we serve as a petitioner how are we associated with these people we are actually working outside somewhere else or either building their own company how are we related here for me to act as a petitioner Paul, how are you related to them? So it can go as little, the least amount is I'm only serving as a visa agent for the petition purposes only. And which that means that I'm not doing anything. Like that's the relationship there. Or you can say, if you want them to work with Deep Tech, then you can put stuff in a petition and say like, okay, we'll be directing them to do these activities. Okay, I'll show you, yeah. It depends, like, if I'm just a visa agent or if I'm actually, like, doing some involvement, does it affect the strength of the case or it doesn't matter? Well, okay, so it doesn't matter, but it can help. It can help because it helps show that they have an itinerary of things to do. So say if they're like, I'm a founder. I don't have a business plan. I don't have anybody looking to hire me for my services. I'm just out here with skills and I want to. Make videos about, you know. Making myself so it is like, OK. technically, that's fine. But if you also have, by the way, I'll be working with deep think, and I'm going to be doing this on a weekly basis, and stuff like that, then it helps, you know, create an itinerary of what they're going to be doing the United States, right, because you can technically build software anywhere in the world. But if you have an actual physical reason to be in the United States, you know, saying like, Hey, I'll be speaking for, you know, deep tech, you know, once a, once a quarter or something like that, it helps the petition, but it's not, it's not required, but sometimes it's very helpful if the other person doesn't have like anything at all lined up in the United States that involves a third party. And how long does the process takes the OAN visa? It's about six months. And this is what I know as per my understanding, the whole process from filing to getting it approved. Okay. Well, One thing I heard yesterday, I think I alluded to it, is I heard that, I think it was LegalPad, or one of them was taking like six months to get a draft done, which is crazy. And then from there, on regular processing, you're looking at four to six months on responses, but you can also use premium processing for, um, fifteen business day responses. So the way that deep tech community is going to make revenue out of it is by charging from the people who's going to apply for the visa a fee. Yeah. To act as a petitioner. And then it will be diverted to the law firm and they will have their own charges and own handling things in there. Right. So you can do it both ways. You can charge for all of it or you can just charge your petitioner service and the law firm will charge directly for the legal portion of it. I prefer to do it that way myself. Even me, if I'm working with Gill Law Firm and I'm the petitioner, I charge separately. I usually charge separately. They'll pay for the petitioner service and then they'll pay the law firm for the legal fees. It can be either way. It's just easier. Now, one thing about two is the filing fee. The best way to do it is if you can even charge for this too be like okay we uh we charge a thousand to to actually file a petition and then that will leave you like with like a couple like a hundred bucks or so uh on regular processing or you can say we charge uh four thousand for premium and then you'll say some of it is like a um administrative fee so that way you make a couple hundred dollars but then you can send the petitions on your credit card Right. And this is why it's beneficial, because like, say, if you have fifty people that are filing for premium processing and you're running it through one of your credit cards, you can get so much points. Right. So you're just racking up points and benefits for that if you're into that type of thing. But you're also making like a little bit of revenue from the filing fees. And I think that's the way that deal and legal pad do it. um just from talking to somebody yesterday it was like yeah we paid eight thousand for the oomvs and then we paid another four thousand for premium processing premium processing costs thirty six hundred and five dollars but the premium processing is a fee that is paid uh to the ucis isn't it so it's not related to us anyway well it will somebody has to like kind of well who it is it's more appropriate if it's paid by the petitioner it doesn't have to be but it's just easier that way as a service so that way if you're charging four thousand for the premium saying that includes our service fee of putting together because you can't you can't get into issues with sometimes they accept it sometimes they don't based on uh if somebody's trying to pay their own filing fees right so so they would pay you and then you would put your credit card information on the the form and send that with the petition or the law firm would so I'll show you What is it called? Oh, well, I have this up. That's not the one I wanted. I'll just go to that, okay. Form, credit card, form, yes, yes, yes. I think it's G, six, six, eight, G. Yeah, there it is. So G, fourteen, fifty. So what would happen is like, so you, you guys would, fill out one of these that have like the credit card that you want to use for filing fees. And then when the petition is ready to go and you collected it, you will let us know, will the law firm know that it's ready? And then we put that in. And so if you're charging four thousand for the administration of filing a premium processing, you would keep like three hundred. The rest would go to USCIS. You want to be kind of in charge of that if you can, because when they reject a filing, you might not find out for three weeks. So somebody is in a hurry and you send this off to USCIS and like it declines or the numbers wrong, you might not get that file back or know what happened for three weeks. Then you have to send it back. Right. So it just cost a month because of an issue with the credit card here. so ideally for that purpose and because sometimes it is an issue when people try to pay their own filing fees is best if deep tech was uh the one sending the credit card so since you have been working as a petitioner being honest what is the downside to it The downside to it for me is I end up doing the immigration work for other people's attorneys, even though I'm not getting paid to be their attorney. To me, that's the worst part, because they'll be like, man, my attorney sucks. And I'm like, over there, I'm like, I don't want to look. I start looking, I'm like, oh, no. So that's the worst part. And then the other part is, again, Since I'm an attorney, a lot of times I get the questions that the attorney should answer. That's another thing that we can help with is, and we put it in our proposal, the deep thing too, is like we can make ourselves available once a week or something like that to like where people in your, community can sign on for an hour and then um ask questions during that hour but also we can make a special discounted consultation link to like where you might pay twenty five or fifty bucks but not like the two hundred three hundred to ask whatever you want to one of the attorneys and the link is on the portal let's say have a conversation with a lawyer cost twenty five fifty bucks and we'll make sure that somebody's there to um to answer that because that's the worst part is being asked all the you know that's what employers don't like employers don't like okay I've hired this person I got the visa now they're asking us every day about when they're getting their green card they're like we don't know we're just trying to get you to like are you going to do the work though right so we can be available or the law firm can to answer those type of questions but that's the worst part of being a petitioner for me is I end up writing visas for other attorneys and then Like I'm getting asked all the immigration questions when, you know, they hired somebody else to do that. Cause I do it for more than your law firm. I write, I do petition service for all types of law firms and I write for the law firms too. Okay. So the, the first step that if, first of all, we have to obviously have to discuss it with origin and have a good discussion around it. So this recording will be available. Isn't it? Let's say it again. this recording is available for me because I would like to discuss with origin and see and go over it again. So I make sure I understand everything. And he also understands and we can make a decision from there. That was the first step. And the second step, like if we agree to become a part of it, what's the first, uh, so it has to be LNC or a nonprofit. It could be either one. It could be what makes more sense. I'm sorry for all the questions. No, no, no, you're fine. I think ideally, preferably LLC, but if it is a nonprofit, that's fine. It's just, we might have to explain a couple more things. Like you might just have to put a clause here that explains things. What will that, those couple more things that you have to explain, you say? Let me see. I think there's a... Because sometimes they'll call it like a sponsor organization. And one other question I have, like, so I file for somebody, I petition for someone. The person can still work under companies. Is that true? The way we do it, so we make it so that's the case. Like, normally you'll do it so that... The most common way is called direct employment. Let me bring it back up. Yeah, because this is what I was looking at. Actually, like, this is so weird that in the morning, this is the same conversation I was having for my sister. And they were like, you have to be tied to a company that files for you. And you have to be tied for them until unless you really like, because you are there for doing some project. That's why they give you the visa. So you have to be completely tied with them. Oh, I see what happened. Oh, there it goes. No. So yeah, normally that's the case, but it depends on how you structure the petitions. So I'm going to show you. Yeah. So look, most people that deal with tech companies, can you see this? Okay, here we go. I'm going to make it a full screen layout. Now you can't see my face. I know, very sad. But I'm going to make this bigger. All right. Okay. So most tech companies are always doing direct employment, right? Because they don't really know about these other four things that are here. So when we're doing our petitioner agreement, one is we're going to explain why it's customary for a US agent to be appropriate in this. So it's like, hey, they're a freelancer and they're not going to be tied down. And so we have their So if deep tech has things for them to do, we put it under direct employment activities. If they have employers, we'll put them here. So we'll put all their employers here along with the form. If they have their own businesses, we'll list that here. Right? So this all goes under the same petition because we're letting them know that we're filing as these different structures. Now, is this something that everybody should play with? Absolutely not. So if you go around playing with this, you don't know what you're doing, then you might run into some issues. But what I'm saying is some immigration attorneys haven't operated in the space other than direct employment. So they don't know what type of leeway there is to have other activities and the nuanced language to say like, hey, my foreign employer, who's actually my family business, is directing me to go and do freelance over here. So that's the artwork that comes in with it. So most attorneys just don't know. And I only know this because I've done a lot in sports to where it's common to have a boxer or a wrestler that also wants to be in a Netflix movie. And they're like, I don't want to pay for another thing. Can you make it so I can do this and my Netflix movie and sell clothes? I'm like, sure. At the time, it was like, I don't know. We can try. I said, sure, Sherry. We trust you. It turns out it's perfectly fine. Here's the thing. Say you're employed by Google, right? And you try to get them to file for all of this. If they fire you, you lose all of this. But if your petitioner is deep tech and you had a conversation with Google, say like, hey, Google, I know you want to hire me. I don't want you to be involved in my visa process. Fill out this multiple employer form and I'll get my authorization for you. But this other company is going to serve as my petitioner. then if they end up getting fired by Google, their visa is still intact, their visa is still fine. Because if they were with Google, they'd have thirty days to leave the country or find a different status. But this way... But other employers should fill out this form. No, no, so this is deep text form. No, I mean like they should at least let them know that this is the process. Yeah, they should let them know, ideally. Now, if they think that they would have a, well, yeah, they should let them know because even if they want, the worst case scenario is Google will be like, no, we want to file our own visa, right? You can have two O-ones at the same time. Then you'll say, okay, well, I want you to file an O-one, but make sure to click the box called concurrent. I'll show you. I'm not making this up. There's so much nuances to it. Hey, watch this. It's right there. Form I-. Look at this. Yeah. So you have new employment. So you can have continuation of approved employment. So this is if you do a renewal, you don't change anything. A change in previously approved employment can be adding things to it. So say if that's one way to do it. So you're with deep tech on a petitioner service. Somebody wants to hire you and they're not comfortable with the current visa. They can choose to have them change that to also include the new employer. Right. Or you can do this D new concurrent employment. That means you have two or more visas at the same time. And we need them because this is what happened. If they do, the new company wants a concurrent employment, they'll wanna get authorization from Deep Tech that they're okay with it. So whoever has the visa first has to sign off and say, we give permission for this new employment to happen. So they have to come back to you. Okay. that was a lot of information at once I would have to I definitely need a time to soak all that in right but there's a reason I show you the form seems like I'm not making this up it's it's right here it's right in for my one twenty nine okay because I feel like you can have two pieces at the same time I'm saying yes new concurrent employment or a change in previously approved employment if you're adding in a new petition this see Okay. I think, yeah, I would like to sit with Arjun and go through this recording again and try to understand any nuances that I feel like I need deeper in understanding and would not bug you with the questions. Once we understand that and if we make a decision that I can come back to you and see how to proceed from there and how can we collaborate. There's one question that you asked me I didn't answer yet. You asked me like, what's the first step? I think this one will work. I'll try another one. So this is mostly for OAN visa, isn't it then? That's correct. We do do EB-A's, but they don't need petitioners. So that's why I didn't bring it up. Okay. So the first step will be something like this where we'll have you fill out this information about like your business, your EIN, things like that. And then we'll probably have you sign some I-I-I-I-I-I forms. So that way we have them ready to go. So we don't have to like keep asking you like to sign them. So as people go, we have a stack of your forms that are already signed. We put them on and we can send them out. But we don't send petitions out without you seeing it first, you know, of course. but it's an administrative step that, um, saves a lot of, saves a lot of time. So that's the first step. You just fill out one of those questionnaires and sign some I one twenty nines, and then we'll have them ready to go. Okay. Well, what are the downside you say with the nonprofit organizations? All right. So for a nonprofit, we might just have to make it very clear to them that you're not a sponsoring organization or that, uh, that you are. It's more kind of like a sponsoring organization. And the reason I try to avoid that is because they get very nitpicky. So some nonprofits serve as sponsoring organizations, and you can just end up having a spat with USCIS that's not necessary. It's like, oh, you're a sponsoring organization. Please give us your bylaws and your meeting minutes to show that you are like a nonprofit and you're applying. Now, why would somebody want to do that? So say if you're a nonprofit and you have like five hundred employees. you get the lesser filing fees if you are considered a nonprofit. But to do that, you have to be a sponsoring organization, which they'll ask for all that so that they can charge the lower filing fees. But if you only have seven employees, you're getting the lower fee anyway. You're getting the same fee as a nonprofit would have anyway. Okay. Yeah, so you're just avoiding having to fight with them over something that doesn't matter. I think I would have to talk with Arjun about it now and then understand the more you went through it, I would have to do a good bit of research on my own as well. And then I could get back to you with this and Arjun and I could meet you again. It sounds good. Hope I didn't bore you too much. No, no, no. It is interesting because I was just in the morning learning something along this line for my sister, actually. So... So it seems interesting. And I'll talk with Arjun if it aligns with his principles and see. Sounds good. Your sister older or younger? She's older than me. You're older. Okay. So who is giving advice to who? We give advice to each other depending on which phase of the life it is. If it's a certain phase, I feel she's stronger. With other phase, I feel like I'm stronger here. So it's a back and forth between us. Modest. Great answer. Modest. Very modest. Okay. I got it. All right. Well, I will get you the shared recording of this. I can also download the text of it and make some notes out of that because I'm sure you don't want the whole text of this. uh I would love that too okay you can have the whole text so I'll give you the whole text and the uh links with the whole text I think I would love to go and back and forth to understand some terms that I might not have understand with what you said and I would like to research I just got one request well I'll do it first I got to check out anytime I said think I don't think you have to do that. That's completely fine. I don't think you have to spend time doing that. But now you realize why, because I had all this little nuanced stuff in my head. That's why. Yes. Thank you so much for the time. Hey, you too. You have a great week. You too. Bye. Bye.",,x,x,,

And we are responding to an inquiry we got from a great data scientist that is approved for an I---one-forty probably through their employer. But those can take a while and they're looking to see about their options for self-sponsored solutions for permanent residents. And so I just wanted to talk about that and see what their options are. um in this case I'm looking down because I have their kind of profile in front of me they have a good profile for sure and has some success working in data scientists for some pretty prestigious companies if you know about the industry but the thing is with eb-one you really need to have some more direct proof that you are one of the top in your field or that specific projects that you've worked on would make you worthy of the EB-A. Things that are helpful are publications, publications about the projects that you did, serving in special groups or having special memberships within the industry. But there's another way that makes a lot of sense for data scientists right now. And I'm going to share my screen so that I can show you what I mean. And it might be good to take advantage of this now, but the Biden administration has an artificial intelligence task force that's not just for AI, but it also includes data science. And they have one of their initiatives is to bring more people with AI and data science skills to the United States to train here and definitely fill in the shortages of what we have here. Of those, there's an immigrant pathway that's self-sponsored called the National Interest Waiver. The National Interest Waiver are for foreign nationals that are in the interest of the United States to grant permanent residence despite not having a job offer on that. And it's a self-petition visa that definitely has a pretty good priority date time with it too. So in this particular case, as the person does have a significant career, and data science, but as we can see yet, might not have quite what it takes to get the EB-A the EB-II national interest waiver is a great alternative for a self-sponsored visa that's apart from the employer. So that's our recommendation on this one, and other data scientists out there too. If you want to get a self-sponsored petition, I behoove you to try the national interest waiver definitely before there is a change in administration, if there is one. We don't know, but to be safe, I would get it done soon, at the time of this video at least.",,,,,

It's me. Share it. Just playing. I figured I'd make a video to kind of show what it looks like when I'm doing my thing. So generally I'm bringing up a few tools to help me out to go see what's going on. Open that up. Should probably have these open. I'm gonna be quick, I'm gonna be quick, I promise. Bad password. All right, we're in there. Then, you know, let's open a Gmail thing. Okay. So generally when I'm coming in to call individual clients, I'm trying to do it on like mass. it was the case that there was a system in place that when anytime a lead came in, Jonathan was trained to, um, send something back to them. Now notice it is August, on this sheet right here, it is August as far as the last time there was an entry. At least there is, um, some, some links in here, but this one says by stripe. What is this? Are these stripes supposed to be here? All right, cool. So those are good. What was this? This is, this is by stripe for this person. I'm no longer active. Okay. And this one is, uh, make sure that this is you guys. Yes. Here. But nonetheless, so you see how this is the twentieth. And then if I go to the Gill law firm, um, one, I think this was good for me. We got the twenty eighth, the twentieth. We have all these leaves, right? We have all these leaves that did not make it on to onto the sheet. Furthermore, Like, notice, like, if I'm trying to go get, like, calls, like, through, like, I can't really see what's going on. You know, as opposed if I got an actual form response sent to me, then just, like, you know, going through this, it's really kind of hard to see very quickly where, you know, what's actually going on. I have to kind of copy and paste it and stuff like that. as opposed to if it just came through a form that's in my Gmail that looks like a Wufoo form. Let me give you an example. See, if I get this, I can quickly look through it. And it could be the case that I hope that Google Forms can send a response to you that looks like this and also populate the form, which I guess if it's your link, the GIL link would be right here. Now, here's the other issue. I don't know if when somebody gets on this list, if Jonalyn is sending something back to them automatically or if there is an automatic response. using, we can have it that she doesn't have to be the one that do that. Uh, we do have the Lido tool, um, that I'm still paying for it and have a couple of use cases that we can probably get an automatic response sent from just having, um, the spreadsheet. So that's what Lido does whenever there is a change or an addition to a spreadsheet, they can do all types of things with it, including sending out emails that are customized already. All right. Um, Who are these people now? The other thing is, if I'm trying to follow up on them and give them pricing. There is no here. There is no place to put links for payment. And then if I go to form. Form one. Just across cross reference. Let's see. So here. The latest one is twenty five. We did have some leads from twenty eight on this one. OK, and I'm not quite sure when which one is filled out first or second, but I'm looking at the legal fees and the filing fees to kind of figure out who is being charged, what they're not here. I have to go over here to find that. And then again, this one hasn't been populated since eight twenty. So I don't know if these people are being sent invoices at all. But needless to say, it is not good for the business development. The other thing I want to show you is a lot of times people want to know what's the pricing and how long does it take. We have custom links that we use to... That's not good. Looks like there's a problem with the payment link. So people just want to know pricing and how long it takes for both websites. We have custom links for that. So if we do P one, eight thousand dollars. Right. So it has the legal fee, government fee options, explains it all out. We also like so if they want to do it, you want a. You do it, give you one A process. We also have this for shared sports visas. So it has a video and breakdown of all the options available to them. Our reason of bringing this up is We couldn't make it automatically that once a price is put into the spreadsheet, it automatically sends a message that has this explanation along with the payment links involved. But either way, what we have here is not ideal. And because we don't have payment links and then for some reason, this stopped on the eight twenty. But what I do now, And usually when I'm doing the business development part is I just go to the list and I start calling quickly and I make videos while I do it and kind of see who's available, who's a good candidate and go from there. But I hope this video helped provide some context for later when we get on the call. Peace.",,,,,
Aug.29.2024,SSV - P-1 Visa Detailed Questions - Timing_ Working_ Etc,Immigration Sports,SSV - P-1 Visa Detailed Questions - Timing_ Working_ Etc,SSV - P-1 Visa Detailed Questions - Timing_ Working_ Etc.mp4,SSV - P-1 Visa Detailed Questions - Timing_ Working_ Etc.mp3,"Hello, this is attorney Sherrod Seward. And today we're talking P-one visas. We just got some great questions about the details involved with these petitions for internationally recognized athletes. The first one is, is when doing a P-one visa that comes with competition and training schedule, what are the type of activities you can do besides that? One thing to know is that The P-one visa is primarily for competition and training for those competitions. The things outside of that should be looked at as doing a sponsorship. So if you are employed by the same entity that's doing your petition work, Then, of course, doing things for them to help promote their business or help things kind of run smoothly is OK. But what is not OK is like being on the website saying, hey, I'm the skiing coach. You should be listed as a skiing athlete. And if you are doing things as far as like activations, while you're training, they're helping other people out, things of that nature that should stay there. But you definitely do not want to say. on the website that you're being a coach as opposed to being a athlete. And then when you're doing your activities, make sure that your competition and training is kind of coming first. And then the other stuff that you do around the facility is ancillary. Think of ancillary. Think of the example is like if you're an NBA player, of course, you're going to do a lot of commercials and things of that nature, show up to events, do a lot of other things outside of the basketball court for your organization. but your primary thing that you're listed on is a basketball player, not a basketball ambassador. If the process was started shortly and paid for the expedite, when would be the estimated time of the answer from USCIS. So if you use expedited processing, which is premium processing, you get your answers in fifteen business days or less. So you can be approved as soon as a couple of days, which happens, or they'll issue a response, which is usually either an approval or a request for more evidence. When you respond to that request for more evidence, if there is one, then it will still have that fifteen business day timeline for that. And then the next question they asked is what's the cost for the procedure of the visa application? Usually regular processing takes about a thousand dollars and premium processing is unfortunately all the way up to almost four thousand dollars these days. Oh, the other thing I should say is if you're not currently in the United States on a visa, you'll need to do consular processing. That includes if you're in the United States on the ESTA visa waiver. But if you're in a situation where you're on OPT or F-I, you just change your status to the new visa as soon as there is an approval, you're deemed in that new category. And then if you leave the country, you would just need to do a consular processing to have that applied to your passport to return on it. So I hope this is helpful and good luck out there.",,x,x,,
Aug.29.2024,SSV - Esports - Brothers one plays one streams - what to do_,Other Video,SSV - Esports - Brothers one plays one streams - what to do_,SSV - Esports - Brothers one plays one streams - what to do_.mp4,SSV - Esports - Brothers one plays one streams - what to do_.mp3,"Hello, it's attorney Sherrod Seward. And today we're discussing a very talented family, set of brothers that are great at esports and esports, I would say, related activities. So we got an inquiry for a player that was successful in Rocket League, which is an esports tournament, both at the collegiate and professional levels. And they wanted to know what would be their best visa option when they're switching to a new game. And then they also wanted to know about the brother of this person who has a streaming platform that they have about ninety thousand followers. And so we just want to kind of break that down a video to talk about how we would approach this. First off, the easiest way would be with the first son that is in Rocket League is that if he is playing Rocket League again, you would just use his rankings, which of he was at least as high as top ten in the world. And there are forty million active players. So right there, you can use that as an international ranking. And if it's in the same e-sport, the same game, then that'd be a pretty straightforward P-one, especially with the collegiate achievements can be used in there, too. But since he's switching games, that could also affect the approach to P-one visa. So. What we like to do, and we do this in combat sports, is we make the title of the athlete or player more general. So we call them a world-class professional esports player. So that way you can use the statistics and accomplishments of multiple games just to get them established as a professional esports player in general, as opposed to one that plays in this league or one that plays in this league. That way you can get a multiple year P-one visa, or even in this case, he might be able to get an O-one visa, which comes with some other perks, depending on what his other accomplishments are. And then you can keep it for multiple years and play in multiple leagues on that same visa. Now, as far as his brother goes, we like to put influencers on the one B category. We look at the amount of subscribers. We look at the particular platform that it's on. Monetization can also be very advantageous. And if you have partnerships with brands, we can kind of use those two if the brands are pretty prestigious. If it comes to the case that the O-B is not that likely of a thing that will happen based on the complete background of the second son and his streaming service, then we can add that son as an essential support staff of the first one, saying that he's helping with the streaming service, helping with his marketing and bringing those essential skills to the table. But that's how we would break this down. And I hope you find this video helpful.",,,,,
Aug.28.2024,IGTA - Lido tool - Making edits - Training,IGTA,IGTA - Lido tool - Making edits - Training,IGTA - Lido tool - Making edits - Training.mp4,IGTA - Lido tool - Making edits - Training.mp3,"Hey Franz, how's it going? This one I am making a video about Lido. We've kind of taken over the tool, so I want to kind of look into how we can use this and make changes. Because otherwise, we'd have to wake every week for them to make the changes. And it gets really expensive. So I think it's something we can do ourselves. And I think it would be a great skill to have for you knowing how to do this. So you know that Lido sends automatic messages to different lists and things of that nature based on his contact list here. And one thing to know is that there's tutorials here. How do I add a credential that they can use to make stuff for ourselves? Like for example, send emails to a list. Right now we have them kind of already set up. Automatically send an email if a new row is added to Sheets. There's a lot of things we can do with this, but right now we're just going to focus on marketing. Let me look at this templates thing. Send an email, sell value change. Yeah, I think knowing how to use this to ourselves, we can do a whole lot of good in automation with what we have going on. And we have a lot of situations where we could use automatic emails going out to people systematically, especially through an email that is vetted, like the Derrick emails and stuff like that. What I have in mind to do first is I want to change and correct some of these messages, especially going out to the, um, employers. Right. So here's a version. That's one that's going to the talent pool and the last relations you've been sent. That's the subject line. I don't think this does anything. Well, maybe that is the subject. When you click on this, you know, you can see the links and make sure that they are that they're right. Oh, is that right? Well, I guess so. Cause there's the right candidate sheet. Okay. I'm making a change to mess anything up. Subject. Enjoy. We will get the visas. So these are different subject lines. And I'm looking for this from the first time too. Let's see what this is. Right, so these are a little bit non-compelling. So I kind of want to change these up and create some different things with some things that I made that are based on sports. So our new approach will be, hey, this is something we've been doing a lot in sports. You can do it the same for your team in traditional business. And I think what we can do is actually just go in and change these to reflect those. And then we can change the subject lines here. And that would be enough to get those different messages going. I think there's one. Oh, yeah. So there's three messages. We can just change these automations and these subject lines to have them going out how we want. Yeah. Yeah, so we can change these, then kind of just add three here that are different from this. And I think that would be enough to send those messages with the different vibes. But I definitely want you to kind of look at this tool, the Lidl tool, and then see how we can make these changes. I know for one that we're having a problem with one of the links for scheduling. So let's just see if we can find it. So it's not in that one. Not in that one. Not in that one. Let's see. Okay. Let's go over here and see if it's one of these. So I think This one is its own automation. Like all this stuff over here is one automation where it says like the four subjects. So it picks one of these and then sends one of these messages. But over here, I think these send by themselves. So this one goes to talent. Congratulations. Let's see. So that one's set for me. That one's set for me. So this one I can go and fix. Copy the address and just make sure that it works. Fix that. Which one was that? Yeah. So I think what I'll do is I'll start changing some of these here to reflect sports. But they're saying there's a problem with. Oh. I think it was a flow desk. There's a problem with the flow desk link. Because I don't see anything in here. I don't really see anything in here that's about, um, scheduling. There's no scheduling links. Here's the last one. Right. So the person with the Cincinnati hospital, let's see. Let's view the entire message. Well, maybe you said something, France. Did you? What fellowship? I don't see where you said something about that. It's in the Flowdesk. Let's see. Yeah, but if you could check the Flowdesk and see if that was a problem. Let's see. All right. I'm going to pause it. Hey, Franz, watch how I'm going to kind of revamp these messages going out to include like the sports part. So I got this. You know what? Let me refresh. We're back here. Uh, is that the right one? There's some solutions. Yeah, here's here's one working for so I'll take that and put this in here. Please look at this one. But we want to combine it. With. This kind of message. So they gave some pretty good. So we already used that one. What's this one? All right. So I'd be like, you know, combine the elements of this message. Also include link to this video and the answer action. All right. Then I would get a video from StreamYard. I already have one you can't see. Petitioner service. Agent based structures. All right. So I went and grabbed a video. And so now we're going to go, please write. So I'm not going to use that subject line. Instead, I'm going to use the subject line, kind of like what they have for email too. which is, well, what is the current one? I'm just showing them because I forgot. Current one is high. There's no hassles, we'll say. Right? So I just fixed that. Now let's see what they actually wrote. Oh, that was just the subject line. So let's go back and see what they came with as far as the text for writing. Schedule a call. All right. So rewrite. I want to say I'm a former immigration attorney. I'll save. All right. Somebody's blowing me up. We got this, we like it. I'm going to, this is email two. I want to copy in the... Okay. There's a subject line. And then let's get that copy. Okay. Now make the HTML version of this. So we're going to let it do the whole code, right? All right, so then we copy the code. We're gonna go to Lido. Where's Lido? So Lido's right here. We go here and then we can go to show raw HTML. Bam, delete, copy, unsupported elements. I don't know. Let's cancel. Open this up again. I'm going to hopefully copy all that. Then I'll go back. And go back to chat GPT and said, So I'm saying it has to be the same format as this. I don't know how to code, but I'm just saying that one works, so I'm going to use this one. I'm saying make it like that. Wait for it to finish. All right. Oh, still going. still going but the main part is that we can consistently switch up these messages and the next thing we need to do is um figure out how to get better about knowing when it sends and how much and stuff like that so I'm going to be looking into that myself quite a bit And I encourage you to, because like with this tool, we can actually do this for other people, like on some white label stuff. But we need this for the talent agency to send to job applicants as they come in. So let's erase all this. Put it in. See if we can save it. All right, so let's see if we got it right. Boom. StreamYard, shared convo. Save. All right. So let's look at this one. So I'm going to take this one. Let's say, okay, now look at this message. We might need the link, the actual link. Okay. Now we're going to say also look at this one. Let's see if we have one about I-Nine compliance. We might not. I'm not going to say that. Okay. We'll look at, what's the INI compliance? I'm going to just go grab it again. Let's approach. OK, does this speak? No one. I made one about I-Nine compliance. See if I can find it. Maybe I'm making subject lines too long. Okay, it's going to say which. Basically, I'm trying to figure out which one did have. Okay, third private petition. Okay. Take text from this and make a combined message like this that speaks sports approach and the H-I-B issue. and includes both videos and the call to action. There is the video link to the issue of I-Nine compliance. Entertainment approach. Immigration success stories. So I'm going to copy the link. So here we're going to switch this subject line. GlobalV is ready for hire. So I like that. So for our own reference, we want to take that and put it here as email three. Let's see what we have on the output. You're right. um. okay okay make this now how to comply with I nine or I like this. Okay, so let's take this copy. Put it here. Okay, then I can make the same mistake. So let's go here. Open this. Wrap all this. I'll say like write this in HTML style. That is. Let's see what it does. The only way to know if it worked is to write out. Is it all in there? Safe. All right, so we'll keep it here for now. But what I imagine is that now it will send We'll send these out with this updated copy in here. And that should be pretty good for us. And for A. For A subject. For A subject. For C subject. Okay, so this one is one where we can change the body of these ones. So four A is one. So how many sets of lines are there? Four A, four C. Ah. Well, this is the informative one. I'll look at that a bit later. But that's definitely one I can change too. Okay. Stop this one, it's a long one.",,,,,
Aug.28.2024,Sherrod and Liam make Nicket Thomas Custom GPT,Business Development or Marketing,Sherrod and Liam make Nicket Thomas Custom GPT,Sherrod and Liam make Nicket Thomas Custom GPT.mp4,Sherrod and Liam make Nicket Thomas Custom GPT.mp3,"How's it going? This is Sherrod Seward and... Nicole Thomas. What are we doing today? Making chat bots. A chat bot. We're making a robot brain to speak like who? Nicole Thomas. Nicole Thomas. That's right. We're going to... I need to... So the first thing we're going to do is open up our computer screens. Here we go. And open our eyes open. We go to explore GPTs, and we go to create. All right. The next thing we're going to do is we're going to get existing writings we've done on this to use our knowledge base. All right. The next step that we do is we upload documents that we have on the topic, which we do right here. Oh, nope, I said it. Upload files. So the idea here is that these files will be, shouldn't it be more than this? I feel like we downloaded more than this. What did it get wrong? The purpose of uploading the documents is that it trains the machine learning to go through that before it issues responses. And context is everything, isn't it? So what's this? What do we have here? What are we uploading right now? This is a business plan. Yeah. And usually we like to download in Microsoft Word as opposed to PDFs because the learning machine tends to look at that a little bit more detail. Then we're also going to upload the original wording from the website. Bear with us on any lag. Should have more RAM in this computer. Website instructions. So download that. So once we download these documents, we're going to all upload them into what they call the knowledge base. All right. So then we simply go here for the file house under this format. I think that they, uh, they let you upload about six to eight documents. We're only going to use this for now. Okay. All right, we're back. In this portion, you can see we're not sharing a screen, but I do have my phone right here. The reason is because sometimes talking is better than typing. So we're going to use the phone version of OpenAI ChatGPT to do some dictation. Say dictation. Dictation. Yep. All right. Hello from Nicol Thomas, LLC. What we are is a toy and lifestyle branding company for young entrepreneurs and budding scientists. Nicol Thomas is a character that is a boy of seven years old of African-American descent. And he often visits his dad at his race shop. He is a mechanic for one of the best racing teams in the world. Nickel Thomas has the unique ability to talk to cars and figure out what's wrong with them and talk to them about their life, feelings, stories, challenges, and attributes. We are now making a custom GPT that's going to learn how to speak in Nicol Thomas' voice and access our pre-existing knowledge base to get more context of how to issue out context for our websites, landing pages, books, YouTube pages, YouTube descriptions, Instagram posts, and TikToks. Period. Now, please write a prompt for this custom GPT. All right. We are back. We are back. Sorry for that. We have the super chip. Super chip. This is a super chip. You can see it's a little chip that helps you talk the cars. It opens their engines automatically. That's right. Nickel Thomas always goes with a super chip, and that's why it can talk to the cars, right? Because it obviously doesn't know what the cars are saying, and also... can tell you this this super chip is you know on the back it has some old tar on it that's how it connects what we put that in the car's computer because cars have computers so when you put some nickel the super chip into the computer that's how you can talk to the car like the tesla was and then and then It's acting. You know how Nintendo, you can also do this stuff for Nintendo ship. You see the Nintendo super ship. All right, back to the programming. So as you know, last time what we did was we used our phone to dictate a prompt and then we refresh the computer and look, it's right here. Yes. So we take this prompt and we're going to go to where we're building the custom GPT. Instead of configure, We're going to go to Create. And we'll use this. Uh-oh. Oh, here we go. So we place that prompt in here. And then we press the text, use this to make a custom GPT perfect for producing content with this context and the voice of a A very educated seven to ten year old. Now, as it says it's updating to GPT, it is riding a robot. You know one thing we're missing? We gotta tell it to have a picture. We just have a picture of like some type of car, right? Like a picture of one of my cars? Well, no, like we can get it to produce a picture. I want to take a picture of it on my car and send it to the GT. Oh, yeah? Or like a watch or something. Because a watch is more bot-like. The thing is, we didn't bring the equipment for that. Oh, wait. How about this? Make an image for the logo for this bot to be a die-cast toy car that... is as fast as a tour tour to a tour let's see what it comes up with it's taking its time in it Hurry up. So while it's doing that, we'll go over here and say, give us a nice description of this bot that explains that you can issue content in the voice of the Nickel Thomas brand. By Liam Seward. Do you want to check on it again? It's nothing but a click. Nothing but a click. It's my favorite. You got a core of it. is the card don't even exist okay like this um yes use this as the image for this um custom gpt it's like that doesn't exist no I think it is it's like a bugatti yeah and look you see you see how it automatically updated that now we got our logo now let's go get our description I feel like this is too long. So let's go back to configure. All right, I think we're done. Now we can preview it. What should we say? Write a blog post about how Nicol Thomas went to the rodeo, met one of daddy's clients. Wait, do you remember what they did? They did the horse racing. The barrel racing. The client told them that the horse was one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. but they were confused when the horse was only how tall? Tall, ten. But then the barrel racer, and what type of accent? What was that? Where were they from? They're from Australia. Yep. Said, what'd they say? They said, look at that horse's butt. The horse turned around and had the strongest butt and back legs they had ever seen. That horse wandered. Okay, write the story. Nichols, Big Roadie Adventure. Oh, no. Look. Look at this. This here is my mic. That's a terrible accent. This here is my mic. I don't know how to do it. This here. Paid a pretty penny for him. How much money was it? one hundred fifty thousand dollars oh look she didn't say look at his back she said this they switched it over they said The barrel racer chuckled, clearly needed to say, ah, it's not about how tall he is, little mate. Look at his back end. She nodded, and the horse gave a small whistle. The horse turned around, showing off his strong, muscular back legs and rump. They were unlike anything Nicol had ever seen, pure power wrapped in his shiny, well-groomed fur. Whoa. I think we got a good story. All right? Not all right. But you know, whatever. It's fine. So good people. Welcome, Nicol Thomas chat box to the world. You can find it in the OpenAI, what do they call it, GPT store. Anybody's free to use, but not the plagiarized. Say peace. Peace.",,,,,
Aug.27.2024,778,Other Video,778,778.mp4,778.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward, and I am following up on a message I sent you on LinkedIn, giving you a heads up that I'd be contacting you. My story goes is I'm a former immigration attorney that specialized in sports and entertainment in the O-one visa category. And now I have a talent agency where we use that same visa category to bring the best talent in the world and more. traditional industries, whether it be software developers, graphic designers, even social media managers, ones that are award-winning and at the top of their field in the world, which I was pleased to find out that's exactly what you guys do on the remote basis. I had an idea that I want to kind of just have a conversation with you and your team to see if there is a way to work together to not only offer the freelance opportunities that you guys do, but through us, we can provide it and make it where they get work visas to actually come to the United States if they're not here already and work on site or even get full-time placement here in the United States. And it's something that's pretty lucrative from our side because we get placement fees and it's something that we can partner with on the revenue and on the talent pool. Because one thing we do need is more talent that is already vetted at the top level of their field. The other thing is with your vetting process, it could be something that is very useful for clients that we have that are interested in working United States to go through your platform, get vetted because you have the system that says they're in the top three of the world, which is something that would be very advantageous to us on the side of applying for visas because you're. Vetting process is thorough and also the reputation that Toptal has is excellent and that would fit well into their immigration packages we put together and also when we try to pitch them to our employer partners. But I just wanted to introduce myself and see if we can have a short conversation. Thank you for your attention to this.",,,,,

One is that a lot of these are on short notice opportunities and there is simply no time to wait months long for the H-1B process where you have to... advertise a job placement, place the candidate, wait for the season to be open to apply and just sit there and wait, and then do consular processing. You don't have time for that in sports. A lot of that is very short notice. The other part is cost. In sports and entertainment, you know, you think about a movie, there are sometimes hundreds of people that have a small part in making the movie happen. And if you're paying for O1 visas or even H1 visas for that, the cost on that would be astronomical. And that's a lot of reasons why. agent-based petition is so prevalent when it comes to this. But you have the opportunity to benefit from that too. We know that employers are not only filing new H-1Bs, of which only about 18% of the half a million that are applied for every year get through, but there's also significant costs with renewing the visas and also with employee transfers. We know that premium processing right now is costing around almost $4,000 with USCIS and filing fees. And that doesn't even get to the probably 4,000 or so that you'll spend with your immigration council if you're not doing the H-1B process in-house. What we do is make it so that you're pretty much paying the same that you would for a retained recruiter on one job posting to establish the relationship and contract we need to make our US agent structure work for you. And if you're thinking about you're just paying that once as opposed to some companies are paying for H-1B visas hundreds or even a thousand times over per year, it's a significant cost reduction then it's a significant reduction on stress of the personnel because the other thing that we do is make it so that the talent that's placed with you through us will come back to us in our own immigration council to ask questions and we train our talent to refrain from asking that from the employer Even when it comes to such thing as permanent residence, in our case, the O-1 visa is an excellent pathway to the EB-1A visa that does not need a employer at all. It's a self-petition visa. And then we also kind of tend to deal in industries where we can do national interest waiver for EB-2, which is another way that we can get our talent green cards that they want to do without having to involve the employer.",,,,,

So pretty much the whole time for about seven years, this is pretty much the structure that we used all the time for some of the premier organizations in sports and entertainment. For example, we probably were doing more combat sports petitions than any private practice in the nation. And this was often done on an agent basis to where we'd have a talent manager that would have boxers, and then that boxer in turns would compete with top-ranked boxing, which of course is on ESPN, some in Matchroom, which is on DAZN, and then Showtime with their promoters. So one of those companies is involved with public trading and has to be very careful about how they categorize their employees but the way we did it was something that was very common and that talent was able to maybe even compete for all three of those organizations on the same year uh depending on what their relationship was whether you know they were on a long-term contract or just doing a short project which would be like one fight we then started using this for executives for example we had a um a whole cricket league and then also a mixed martial arts promotion that was setting up here in the United States. We were able to get an O-1 visa for an executive and then pretty much fill out their entire staff with essential support staff visas to that person. And then when they got here and established their own entity, they were able to use all of those people that were on third party petitioners to get the I-9 compliance done. and staff that entire organization. We then moved on to do this with situations where there'd be talent that is in a more kind of streamlined industry that had a job offer, but the employer did not want to do anything with the visa process. And so they asked us if we can do the same thing that we're doing in sports after seeing our videos on YouTube. And we were able to do this. We had one individual that was a data scientist, and he's been able to work with companies such as Goldman Sachs, Insight Global, which is one of the best consultancy firms for tech in the world. And he's moved on to several similar organizations all on the same visa without having to change at all. And that's the solution that we're bringing to you. You can enjoy the top talent in the world without having to participate in the immigration process and also have nothing to worry about when it comes to I&I compliance.",,x,x,,

Typically, say, for example, if this was a model that was going to do some extended projects with different brands, those brands would be included in what's called a deal memo. It's not uncommon for this deal memo to just simply be a couple sentences within the contract that's included to USCIS with their 01 petition that says, brand A, we'll have them do this at this location from date to date. and have a signature that from a signatory that says they're okay with it and just kind of list those out. What we do is because we don't know on the corporate side, compliance could be, there's more people involved and there's more stakes because there's a lot of publicly traded companies that are going to make sure that there's no problems. So what we do is we actually have an agreement specially tailored to lay out the relationship that our talent agency has with the stakeholder. And this relationship typically is put to the test with some compensation just so USCS knows that there's skin in the game. But then USCIS will also know that this is not unspeculative employment. And that's one of the reasons we have the contract. and that we do have consideration payments that are made on a monthly basis just to lock in the notion with USCIS that this is not speculative employment and that there is an expectation that talent will be provided to the employer in these unique industries that they say put. And then oftentimes we'll also have that following up with an email to us that will include with USCIS to lock in a specific candidate if it makes sense. So that allows for the I-9 compliance to be pretty simple because we have the contract that USCIS can know what's been going on and contemplated. And also, when you get the O-1, there still is an I-94 that will show the current status of the individual being in O-1. And they can go and turn, use that to get a social security number. And you can use those files in your documents when you submit your I-9 compliance reports.",,x,x,,

One of the questions that we have from employer partners when it comes to doing business with us is trying to fully understand how the agent structure works. We know that most employers that deal with foreign nationals are serving as the direct employer, meaning I've hired this employee and I'm also filing the visa for them in a direct employment situation where we specify, we probably even advertise exactly what the beneficiary will be doing. The only difference here with what we do is that the employer does not have to serve as the petitioner and gets to stay out of the process when it comes to the whole visa. Now, we get a lot of questions about how does this work on our compliance side as far as having I-9 compliance and how to categorize the worker. Do we have to do them as a 1099 or can we have them on W-2? The great thing about the O-1 visa is it can be either one. But what we do to make sure that the I-9 compliance stays in place, just the same as if you were filing your own H-1B, is set up the U.S. agent for multiple employers scenario so that USCIS knows that the employer is actually a third party and then that employer can do their normal compliance issues and, you know, dotting Is and crossing Ts to make them comfortable with how the employee is categorized and how the employee has obtained their work authorization. So there's no issues with USCIS, and there are also no issues with how you have to report your employees versus contractor status to your shareholders and stakeholders.",,x,x,,

And now I'm on the talent agent side of things to where we're helping mainstream companies, companies that are not in sports and entertainment, take advantage of the same structure when it comes to doing their global mobility and bringing people to the United States. Typically, a lot of movie studios and sports promoters do not want to have anything to do with the immigration process and will only consider talent that already has their immigration status figured out. In fact, if you look at most high level combat sports promotion agreements, they'll specifically say that the talent is responsible for getting their own visas. Well, how would they do that? Well, this is possible when you deal with P1 and O1 visas, which permit agent-based structures for filing the visa, which means it's very common for a third party to file for the visa based on projected projects that the athlete or actor or film crew person will be doing in the future. That makes it so that the employers, in that case will be studios or combat sports promotions in this example, would just have to express interest in having the talent compete in their event or be in their movie. and they'll stack those up and use that to say over the next three years which most o1 visas are for you can expect that this talent will do these type of activities and that's what we're doing with our talent agency we're basically partnering up with employers to fill that role of what would be a movie studio or a sports league and saying that, hey, we express interest that we want Global Talent Agency to give us people in these type of skill sets. And sometimes there might be a follow up email with a name just to solidify that. And it makes it so that the employer can enjoy world class talent that's worthy of an O-1 visa, which is a very high threshold. and then not have to deal with the immigration process. They will pretty much be just the same as a natural born citizen when it comes to can you hire them on the spot without having to participate in the immigration process and pay significant legal fees for each applicant. And that is what we're doing here. The same thing that's done in sports entertainment on a regular basis fits very well for more traditional industries. And we will show you how to do that.",,x,x,,

I'm formerly an immigration attorney that did a lot of business in sports and entertainment, primarily dealing with 01 visas in the Asian based structure. Since then, I've of course founded Innovative Global Talent Agency, where we've jumped over to being on the talent side of things and sometimes even the direct employer side of things. And I just kind of wanted to introduce myself and talk about how we support immigration attorneys still doing the good work with their clients. So one thing we do is we do serve as petitioner for clients that do not have an alternative or maybe need a better alternative than direct employment. One of the things we offer besides that is we also do itinerary consulting. If you do own one visas, you know that itinerary and stuffing it with things to do can be difficult, especially for freelancers, startups, founders, even people that are coming on short-term gigs. So what we do when we serve as petitioners, one, we provide placement services. So we have employer partners that we have relationships with to use on the itineraries of O1 visa applicants. We also work with applicants directly to set up things in the itinerary that will be with us. For example, if we're dealing with software engineers, founders, We might put some in-kind things that they can do as far as dealing with projects on some of our employer clients or some of our own projects in the itinerary to just help stuff it with things to do before they're placed with an employer. With founders, we might work with their company to produce projects collaboratively so that way they can have full control of their business without having to have a board or have a partner there to avoid issues with service of process in owning the petitioner-sponsored entity. And we do all types of things to make it really easy for the beneficiaries to get the O-1 without having to deal with the hassle of not having things to do in their itinerary and with the benefit of getting placed on projects as a job or even projects on a short-term basis. But I hope you find this helpful. And call to action would be just have a conversation with me. like to see more about your practice because we refer out all the time to qualified immigration attorneys that we trust in certain industries. And I think you'll find it helpful and take some things off your plate when it comes to the itinerary contract part of the business. But have a great day and I look forward to talking to you soon.

We did make a decision on that front, but I have some good news. The good news is I think that you'd be excellent to earn some income very, very passively just by referring us foreign nationals to our executive placement program. It's something that pays up to two hundred two thousand dollars. And all you have to do is refer people to to our business, people who are foreign nationals and looking to work in the United States. And I imagine as a human resource professional and talent staffing person, you might come in contact with a lot of people that express interest in getting H-B visas. And all you have to do is just send them a link that will ask a couple of questions about them and ask who referred them. If we place them into our executive placement program, we will pay you a twenty percent up to two thousand dollars for each candidate. What is our executive placement program? Great question. Well, it starts with this. We are founded by immigration attorneys who specialize in O-one visas in sports. We're talking top level, ESPN, NFL, NBA. We've done it all. And there's a unique way that we use O-one visas and agent-based relationships with employers to do things. So our executive placement program will have an applicant pay us a certain amount of money, usually it's around fifteen grand, and what that includes is a regular processing O-one visa petition, and it gets them to the front of the line when it comes to placement with our employment partners. So all you have to do is just use a link to send to them. They answer a couple of questions for us. And if we sign them up, we get you paid. But I think with your background, your skill set and existing network, you can do some significant income without lifting much of a finger. So if you're interested, just indicate and we will get you to the next step of this process. But again, thank you so much for applying for this role. We really appreciate it.

And today we're discussing a inquiry we got from a very talented individual that wanted to know if they are qualified for EV one a, and they are a fencer. Fencing is a great sport and it's an Olympic sport. So when we have that, that's a great place to start from where you went to Olympics. In this case, the answer is yes. And they are one of the only, well, I think they are the first fencer from their country that was able to compete in the Olympics, which is great for original contributions and stands well for the EB-A or the O-one. Next, they say they've also won a bronze medal in the World Cup. That means at one point in time, they were the third best fencer in the world. And that, of course, is an extremely compelling argument for getting the EB-A as well. And they've also won second bronze in the Asian Championship and a silver medal in the Asian Championship. This is a great resume that shows that this person is for sure one of the best fencers in the world at one point in time. And that's enough to support the EV-A when it's captured properly in the arguments. Now, when doing the EB-A, you have to look at it structurally to see your timeline and where you need to be in the world. For example, if you're in the United States, you have the option of filing for your EB-A first and then seeing if you get approved and then file for your adjustment of status. And that's advantageous to maybe if you have a borderline application. But in this case, if this person's in the United States, it's probably best for them to file for EB-A and their adjustment of status for green card at the same time. When you do it that way, you will have to stay in the United States for probably six to eight months while you wait for your adjustment. Well, you wait for your parole, advanced parole, which allows you to travel in and out of the United States while you're waiting. And for your work authorization, it gives you a blanket authorization to work anywhere that you want to, but it also takes about six to eight months. So when you're doing EB-A with the adjustment status, be sure that you can stay in place for a while. Now, if you're outside of the United States or you need to be back and forth, then you need to look at consular processing. That's when you'll do your EB-A, get it approved, and then apply for consular processing for your green card. at a consulate abroad, which usually should be your country of origin if the embassy is open. If it's not, then there'll be alternatives that you can go to and go to third countries, third party countries to do that in the circumstance that the embassy is not available in your country at the time. But in this case, fencing, great sport. This person has a bronze medal in the World Cup, a first olympian from their countries and the youth olympic games two bronze asian championships and a silver medal in the asian championships this is a excellent candidate I'd say you can go straight for the ev-one a and then just make the decision whether you want to stay in the united states if you're already here and adjust status or if you want to wait and get consular processing If it's the case that you're in a hurry and you're abroad, it might not make sense to apply for the EB-A, but instead apply for the O-A, which this person is also qualified for. And that can have them in the United States within two months with a quick application and a quick decision from USCIS. So that's one thing to think about as well. Hope you find this helpful out there and on guard to all you fencers.",,x,x,,

One thing we find is that there are a lot of students playing poker in the United States, and I've even come across situations where people are in school just so they can stay in the United States to play poker. This happened a lot at the UNLV, which is pretty much right next to the Las Vegas Strip, where I imagine there's quite a few students there from all over the world that are there. just to play poker at the win. But this time we're giving an evaluation on a person that is graduating from one of the most prestigious schools in the United States, especially when it comes to tech and engineering. And they wanna know about how to switch from their F-one student visa status to a P-one status. And as I do this video right now, it is August. So we have a whole semester in front of us. What I would say is taking advantage of time is always a good thing. So for one, with this much time, a lot of effort and meticulousness can be put into the application. Also, it would leave room for having to respond to a request for evidence. um if you do regular processing because regular processing usually takes um three to four months to get a response so if that response is a request for evidence then that would put you right around graduation if you did regular processing right now um looking at the person's profile uh they are well within what we've seen as far as what will give you a high shot and likelihood of being successful in um in poker so We see that there is a good live earnings and we're showing that the all time national rankings are below a thousand and the global poker index is below forty thousand, which is actually pretty good since there's so many millions of people that play poker and there's a lot like hundreds of thousands in the ranking. So this is actually pretty, pretty good. And so I would like to say that this is a great candidate for P one for those reasons. And that the P one is extremely helpful for poker players who are marauding as students. Just kidding. But when you're done, you can certainly use your skills in poker to transfer over to the P one. And this particular profile looks like a great fit. Hope this is helpful.",,x,x,,

There's two things about O-1 visas that just are what they are. One is that the eligibility criteria for O-1s tend to be pretty subjective as opposed to objective, and there's room for interpretation. And that comes to the second part. This interpretation is done by people. And sometimes it's just the case that somebody is a jerk or they are untrained over at USCIS. But when you do O-1 visas, you're going to run into some inconsistency. The question comes in what to do from there. And the particular inquiry that we're getting is somebody that's come to us after dealing with another attorney. So we have to put that into the play. We at our law firm, and the law firms we're affiliated with, primarily only do O1s, P1s, and extraordinary ability visas. So usually on the presentation of the visa is top notch. It's the best foot forward that we can put together for client, keeping in mind the context that we get from hundreds and hundreds of 01s petitions. For other attorneys, they might just do a couple visas per year or every other year. And so they wouldn't be privy to the type of feedback you get from practicing a lot in this area. So that's one thing. Maybe there was a problem with the preparation of your petition and it wasn't as thorough towards being a great petition as it could be. The second part is maybe you got an officer that was not good or maybe you got an officer that's not trained. Nonetheless, when this happens, the advice that I would probably give is usually the same as that. Appeals are not all that helpful and they take a long time. Appeals go right back to the board of immigration, depending Now you do it, usually that's the case. And one, they take a long time. They usually don't get back until six or eight months or maybe even longer. And they cost around the same as a regular processing filing fee. So what we tell for O-1 visa people that have unfortunately been denied is usually just go ahead and file another petition just because you'll get probably another fresh set of eyes. The timing will be the same. It's supposed to be reviewed on its own merits. And it's an opportunity to bolster your arguments or even go with a new counsel that can be maybe more helpful for you and present your eligibility arguments in a better way that USCIS will find persuasive. So that's what I usually say in most denials is to either file another file or even just litigate because I don't find that appeals are all that successful because you're going right back to the same entity that denied to be in the first place and they stand 10. to stick with the decision-making made by other people in their office, which makes sense. But I hope this is helpful to you out there, and hopefully you're avoiding denials. But if you do, choose the most sensical way forward.",,x,x,,

Well, one is there are, fortunately, a lot of international competitions, both at the youth level all the way up to college and cheerleading. And the international versions of these and even the kind of continental European, whether it be Asia, Southeast Asia, Competitions are very, very highly respected and they're usually publicized a lot, albeit not in maybe ESPN or Forbes or things like that. But there's definitely a pretty significant subculture within cheerleading that does produce a lot of publications. In this case, we can see that and we can't know whether it's a person has competed in cheerleading and has won competitions or if they did that as a coach. The fortunate thing about O1 is when it's tailored properly as far as the title of the O1, you can use both your past physical competition awards along with the awards of your pupil. And the way that we do that is we say you're a world-class cheerleading professional. We don't say a world-class cheerleader or world-class cheerleading coach. We use it a more generic term so that USCIS will allow us to use both the evidence from competing and the evidence of coaching to get it over the hump. The type of things that are useful in a cheerleading O1 case are of course publications, but also if you are introducing subtle techniques and stuff like that to put it in training manuals, even in YouTube playlists and in social media posts. So that way we can kind of say that you're self-publishing these and offering original contributions to the field. The other thing that's helpful, of course, is the success of your pupils under the comparative evidence theory. You can use the accomplishments and the memberships. By memberships, I mean if you have pupils that are on national teams or if they've been selected to prestigious awards, stuff like that. To say that by the comparable evidence theory, I'm using their accomplishments because I have significantly significantly contributed to their preparation when it came to them getting to the awards. The other thing that's helpful is judging. If you are fortunate enough to be put in a place to where you can judge competitions or even judge practices at a high level, that's also very helpful. And then finally, if you are getting paid as a coach more than other people in your region, not internationally, but in your region, that can also be used under the renumeration theory. But with the particular prospect that came to us, we could see that they had multiple national European and some international championships around Europe and also in the US. And the other thing is they have multiple choreography awards, which we can use for awards and also original contributions for that. And they have MVP awards, which of course. are significant, especially when we can get the expert opinion letters to confirm the significance of those awards and if there is publications on it. So this particular prospect wants to apply maybe four months from now and wants to know what they can do to be successful. The thing is, please try to get as much published or self-published material of your original contributions, whether it be choreography or just coaching techniques. Try to get placements that confirm that the awards you won were indeed the case and talk about the significance of them and have it varied in what countries they appear. So if you have articles in Sweden, articles in UK and stuff like that, let's talk about the same thing. That will help USCIS understand that this is an international achievement, even if it's a national award. For example, if you win a national championship, but that national championship is discussed in articles that are on multiple countries. That's advantageous as well. So overall, just to recap, cheerleading is an excellent profession and definitely worthy of getting an O-1, especially when there is contribution at the international level in competition, choreography, or coaching. In this case, we have all three.",,x,x,,

I'm going to list you for some help for calling up on some leads that we're trying to close. So there's a couple of spreadsheets that we're going to be looking at. One is this Welcome to Gill Law Firm. Get started. Want to share. Actually, what I'm going to do, I'm going to make a copy. Joshua's. So I make a copy. And what we're going to do is I'm going to highlight the ones in green that I want you to follow up and call when you're looking through these. Right. You can. Kind of look at. their notes and stuff like that to get some background on who they are. Okay. Another thing you can do is potentially, let me see if this works. Actually, let's see. I can't really look. Okay, so you can leave that alone. The next one is this client antique tracker. First, look at good prospects. And then I'm going to highlight stuff in green that I want you to call. Then I want you to then look at the approved client lists. And then for them with an approved client list, I'll highlight them in green. And you can either tell them, hey, your visa is getting ready to expire. So if you see that their visa is getting ready to expire, When you go to here, that's when you can do like, hey, your visa is getting ready to expire, or it has expired. Or you can tell them, and then also ask them if they're interested in getting support staff, right? Okay, so that's the job. One is just go through, look at this for the ones that I highlight in green, call them back and see if they're still interested in the visa. Over here, look at goods prospects. If I highlight them, see if they're interested in a visa, it'll be highlighted in green. And then on approved current client business development, actually don't even worry about that yet. This one will get kind of going a little bit later. All right. But yeah, just worry about good prospects and this list. Okay.",,,,,
Aug.27.2024,ILL - Question about denials - Sherrod Seward,Other Video,ILL - Question about denials - Sherrod Seward,ILL - Question about denials - Sherrod Seward.mp4,ILL - Question about denials - Sherrod Seward.mp3,"Hello, this is attorney Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visas and Gill Law Firm. We've got an excellent question from you regarding what happens in the worst case scenario that your O-1 visa is denied. First, I'll say that's extremely unlikely because I look at your background myself. And based on my previous experience, you're a great, great shoe in for the visa under the O-1. But this is how we treat denials. Generally, if there is a denial and it's something that our fault, which barely happens is that we'll just send it back out with filing fees. If it's something to where maybe you got a bad officer, which could happen or just, know this didn't make sense then usually there's just a filing fee and then maybe a small fee of just like an hour time of the attorney or the paralegal to go ahead and kind of switch things up so it can be resent sent out um but yeah that's what happens from a great question of what happens when there's a dial but usually we try to fix it um as low cost as possible but you don't definitely have not have to file um new legal fees, but just filing fees for that. And then there might be a slight cost if we need to rewrite things from the attorney. Hope that helps. Thank you.",,x,x,,

This is attorney Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Swartz Visas and Gill Law Firm. We received your request about a sports visa for your Alpine skiing career. I understand that you already have an employer that you've been working with on OPT. That's great. And I also stand that you want to continue competing. Well, I'll say that my ultimate recommendation is for you to go with the P-one visa because of your NCA background goes a long way towards eligibility there. But I think that the eligibility is going to be tough for going for the O-one. While that would be the best option for definitely working with the ski, the skiing company. I think that if you keep a full schedule of competition, then kind of look at what else you do with the job as a sponsor. Like, you know, I wouldn't necessarily put yourself on the Internet as a coach or anything like that. But just kind of say that you train there and make it more about your competitions. You'll be just fine. to switch from the OPT to the P-one. But from our previous experience, it does look like a tough case to do the O-one, so I definitely suggest one visa. I have the team send a confirmation that I think that you're a great candidate, and they'll tell you what to do going forward.",,x,x,,

Yeah, he doesn't think so. Well, you never do. Right. So how have you been? Making the world a better place? A safer place? Of course. Every day. Yeah. Gotcha. Well, we're trying to help you do more of that. Right. Exactly. So I have a... So you're saying it's just so complex that they, you fear that they won't be able to like actually like read? They would be able to understand it if I told them what it was. Gotcha. But because of the compartment that it's actually in, I don't know if we're going to be able to get them to read on for that. Well, in certain ways, like so if we're doing original contributions, the actual thing might be more important. But The thing is, how long we could take, make the story of why it is important, just like, you know, kind of pointing to like, hey, the bigger picture is. It's more important like that. It's more like telling a story, not like a technical thing. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, then that's fine. Because I had a bit of a panic last week, and I was like, oh, God, I can't tell them anything. No, no. We just need to generally show them that, hey, you're like, so one is we're going to make the job title very distinct, you know, to kind of your skill set, counterintelligence, military background, stuff like that. But most of it is like we're making a story just to say like, hey, this person's really important. You can tell by the roles they're in. You don't have to need to know how they made the sausage. You can just tell by, you know, as the product of where they have made it in this world. Undoubtedly, they have to be one of the best. Fantastic. Okay. Well, then that's fine. We can generalize all day long. Yeah, yeah. Just generalize. And then what would be helpful if there is people, experts out there or whoever you can actually get to to kind of just say like, yes, what she's saying is true as far as like confirming that it is a prestigious way to be. And you only get there by really being good at whatever the sausage you're making is indeed the case. Yes. And I've always spoken to those people and they want to write a statement on my behalf. yeah say it again and those people I've already spoken to them and they are definitely happy to write this oh that's good and then the other thing was we had talked about this before keeps you busy through the agency. So it's something that I said earlier. My idea was that we could put it kind of like as a quasi-consultant role to like, we're like technically not, we don't actually bring people that's fine, but we just need an itinerary to say like, hey, she's doing consulting for us in this particular field of reaching out to other people that are kind of like her and stuff like that. Now we have to do it. We'll definitely cut you in. you know like maybe everyone will take off um a thousand or two we'll take all two down process for everybody that we uh get to sign up and do it and then that one term we can put that in in the itinerary so it works for uh works for everybody all right yeah um the other idea is that it's just an idea if we're gonna need it but like the agency back to that. So like, we can't make it come off. get it, but I can get to one of these and maybe I want to go and I'll work with them again. We can have them in your iceberg. So if there's a problem. Okay, so I'll give you a few minutes. I'm going to stop you because I'm going to go to the next table. okay I say sometimes life be like and that's what the americans say it's time now just don't make any plans yep that's fine and then um worth to have the petition out at least on regular processing in october and then um bring a process for the other stuff comes in okay um Yeah, we've been establishing a relationship with Booz Allen and I believe Raytheon. So sometimes you have to deal with some bureaucracy over there. So it takes some time. But yeah, we do have to know what's going on and we have their attention. We just need to find out what happened to bureaucracy and figure it out. Okay. So I guess my next question is which I'm going to do this evening. And then fill out the candidate sheet. Then we'll work on getting the agreement ready for you. And it should be there tomorrow. No problem. Fantastic. All right. Well, you have a good night. You too. Thank you. Yep. Peace. Bye. Who's ready to go play some, do some fun? I was born and raised in the United States. I do not need a visa. Eric Brown. Is that a boy? It is. How long does it take your drone to charge? Maybe twenty-four hours. Yeah. It doesn't take twenty-four hours. Man, I told this dude this guy does not need a visa. He is a little thick. I think it said it takes to charge. But I This oh, yeah, okay, we'll take it with us. We'll take it with us That quick wait do you ever taste for something else I Yeah. Well, then he wants to play the video games. We got to patronize. But he's going to his mom's house today. And he's not sad about it. Mama's boy. Wesley. Please find the documents we have on the applicant. Context.

We'll keep the show going. Keep the show. So I don't know if you saw, I sent to Joni, is that how you say his name? Yeah, Joni. Joni, yep. Okay, I sent him a headshot title with directed global accounts. I'm basically just throwing a little bit from somebody's inbox. I'm only going to be doing LinkedIn outreach to begin with. Right. And generate large email lists, target lists, prospect lists. But I like LinkedIn for the set up. That makes sense. Hey, Ryan, one question. So, yeah. Even if you can't hear, were you able to see me on the stream yard or no? All right. If you can log in, because what I'll do is I can share my screen so you can see things. All right. So you're at, you prefer LinkedIn because you have it mastered with your own platform. I've got a thing that I've been doing for the last four years that applies to a lot of And once you've got the right copy, you can start to the point where your time is spent doing the real stuff, talking to real people. Gotcha. That makes sense. Okay. I'm coming through the stream yard and your phone. No. Okay. Can you hear me now? Yeah, that's what I just muted the phone. Then, you know, that's all it was. Why is this not working? Okay, cool. So Where'd you want to start? I said, we got into the LinkedIn and I think you're adding me about, um, target lists. I was trying to pull up your email so I could go. Yeah. You know, one of the things that I talked about was, uh, success stories and target candidates that, you know, or candidates that you placed in the past for just sort of a benchmark of what has worked. Oh, okay. Gotcha. So our client base now is like the ones that we have from the immigration side of things. Why does that always do that? Every time I do it on this one. So they're mainly in. We have them kind of like right here. The ones that we have had success on are, you know, normally on the like kind of sports side of things. We do have clients that we've placed with like NBC, with Goldman Sachs and the math company. But those ones are ones that came naturally, like through a client hit us up and they, the petitioner didn't want to like, well, the company didn't want to sponsor. So it happened naturally as like, as opposed to- Right. Yeah, we got closed, but it wasn't through us reaching out to them and put them on a subscription. Lately, we've started our campaign, because it's still fairly new, with getting feedback from schools. So we just had a school system, not at the university level, but high schools and things of that nature, and rural places, they've hit us back. And then we've had... good rapport with hospitals like for example we just had cincinnati children's hospital um contact us back too so medical was was good early days you don't have anybody that's actually got an action you know a perfect role using this methodology but it obviously works no no we have we just haven't done it as going to the the company first usually yeah yeah through the subscription but yeah we've done it a lot it's just not through the subscription base on our first call like one of the first trepidations I had was Well, not always. Well, one is, you know, there are some retainers out there, but they are used to paying legal fees, right? So they're used to paying $9,000 per H-1Bs. And so that's what we're kind of like. Yeah. I think we're really desperate to go with, it either has to be a very low-level job or we're really desperate to go with retainers. So that just cuts the total market of people that are willing to pay a recruiter 2% or 3%. And I think more than 95%. The other thing is we can play with that. So it's more important to us to have the contract with them than them actually paying. So it could be something like, Hey, we'll put you on the contract, but maybe we don't, um, we don't like charge them the whole thing or put, you know, some type of discount to make it. Okay. I think I'm going to go with something like, Okay, that's good They're just not used to Yeah The piece is that there are people out there that pay retainers. Their relationships are super entrenched. Anybody that's going to have, like, a lot of them, I just got a call from a boss, 98% of them, very good. And it's just not going to go on the contingency firms right away. There's just no risk for them. Okay. If they go on the contingency firms and it doesn't work out, this is, like, between retainers. and just not getting a call. So I get slightly less commitment than retaining the search mark. Because let's say you took a role in something you were talking about, like a medical device manufacturing factory or something like that. You got somebody that's a specialist in craniofacial implants or something like that, and they're from Sweden or whatever. That's not a million dollars. $160,000, $180,000 job, they're not going to pay a chance for that, for the most part. They'll either leave the job open forever and ever, or they will try and find somebody and train them. Oh, we found somebody that's got this other skill set, they can hip implant, so they're going to engineer facial things. They would rather train somebody than try to roll that low on the work chart. Or just leave it unfilled for years right before they would retain so that's what kind of level of position they're aiming at um we've been trying to lean about the the higher end because like the thing is the visas we get people uh for the highest like level so they're we're usually trying to get like world-class like kind of like talent you know something that's going to be like and have it be known that Yeah, and then so once we're successful, the client knows, like, hey, they're not replying to job posts. They're keeping a steady pool of world-class, like, talent that we can, you know, put anywhere and change our business. Now, I hear you with this. Oh, let me talk on the business end. So if we end up having to, like, not get, like, you know, some retainer money, we call it retainer, up front, the contract, what we'll do is, like, you know, cut you in W with what that would have been on the placement. So... Just to let you know that if we end up giving up money on a subscription basis, we're not going to leave you out of the conversation. What we'll do is just we'll put it in, we'll cook you into the placement part when we do that. The main thing is we just need these contracts. Once we have the contract in place, we can be placing talent and filing visas. It's not that important that we get the retainer on the month to month. It's just really important to get that contract, that relationship set up so that we can then start sending them all this foreign resumes and they can pretty much treat it the same as if they're Americans. workaround is amazing like it's an incredible idea I mean and maybe that's the sales pitch is it's like hey you can sign up for the retainer but not actually pay until you get a placement but I think I kind of like that I like I mean look they're gonna have to pay for the services the carrot is this talent list that they've never been able to do this do you have a Your other folks are developing the talent list, right? So do you have a roster of folks that are already signed up with visas and stuff? Yeah, so we're developing them now. I'm going to put it in HubSpot. I'll show you. Let's see the back end. Job candidates. And one thing I'm launching with the foreign folks is they're starting to reach out to people that have the skill sets and want to move to the United States, and they just kind of like pay for like their own visa. So I think in a while, there's going to be like a lot like even more that's going to take over that initial capital we need because like the final visa is pretty expensive you know if you found like 50 visas going to cost like you know like 130 grand or so um starts getting up there but we have we just signed up for people in southeast asia that they're going to be going to people and basically they can what we call an executive placement program to like where they pay the money for their visa application and then pay to get put into the front of the line when it comes to actively marketing them and we've already started having candidates already. But yeah, this is, um, this spreadsheet is where we keep the, I want to read that down here is where we, um, kind of put all of our. Candidates that come in for the different kind of jobs and the ones that we go look for and the ones that apply. There's somebody that goes in and kind of takes out the candidates that aren't good fits for O1 visas. But all of this is going to be put into a HubSpot CRM so that we can keep track of all the contacts. Yeah. I can do that in one upload. Okay. You can? No data entry tasks. All right. I heard that it can be live to the Google Sheet. It responds to the live Google Sheet? Yep. There's an integration for that too. We can have it do that or we can do it in batches. I'd rather it be a live. It responds to the live document. That would be the best. Absolutely. The upload I can do for you for free. okay yeah we had a we had a call schedule with hubspot tomorrow because like I know so yeah I mean there's there's a way to do it it's probably through their marketplace um and yeah there's they have built-in integrations for this kind of stuff but it's still not really all that scalable to be using the google sheet that's the reason you're using the crm right yep so eventually you're going to want your people doing the data entry in crm yeah yeah of course yeah yeah that's that's what we want It was like, this is a. Right. Right. Um, well, besides the point, uh, is there, can I have like, I even read only access to this. I'd like to be able to just kind of like have like the sampling in my pocket as I'm talking to people, but I like the idea of pitching this at. We're applying the methodology that sports teams and talent agencies have been using for decades to corporate America for the first time. I think that's going to hit. The way it hit me, it's going to hit HR professionals and talent professionals. Yeah, and then we can show the past performance too. Yeah, let me show past performance. They're not going to care about how many corporate placements we've had. They're just going to want to see that the methodology works and that it's gone through you're you're a pro at this and this has gone through decades or whatever a screw check that makes sense yep so once I get them to respond to that then we got on the phone however we monetize that so be it like we're early early days so we'll just kind of figure it out as we go but yeah all right yeah if I'll be in the door and get the meetings I'm like I'm confident with just a couple minutes to be like oh wow that's right and like I said it's not important yeah subscription I don't see that right so so maybe the contract purpose needs to be introduced to something else it's like this is um this is for your compliance like you know to help you make sure you be comfortable with the compliance piece of this this is the agreement that we do don't worry about the the fees we won't actually kick in until we place you won't pay for anything you don't want right and sharon's an expert he's been doing this forever excuse me here's the track record, this is how it's going to work. The reason we need you to sign this contract up front is not because you're going to come and try and get money for services not rendered. It's because this is part of the legal process of getting done what we're about to do for you. This contract has to exist between us so that we can get these candidates you want. Yeah, and we can talk to them about I-9 compliance, stuff like that, and then so it's not unspeculated work. I can speak to all that. So, all right, so I guess that's the way I go. I like your email, so I'll probably be taking a lot. My messaging is going to be very brief. I think what I want to do is target people that have had jobs that have been open for more than a year in all fields and just see what we get. All right. Let me show you what we have and kind of our list building things. just look over here I'm gonna call my visa jobs so the list of like the employers that is that you can never find something when you need it are you you're helpful thank you my mic and camera work I spent all day that's all good can you see my screen all right um So we do have a person that does data mining. So if you need like, you know, like help with that, getting like lists together, we can do that. But what are we doing? It's like. Okay. Right. I just want to know what kind of lists you guys have built that were successful, but it sounds like that you haven't. Oh, right. Yeah. I see. Yeah. Yeah. True. But we like seeing what you've targeted. Artificial intelligence. you only have reader okay you only have read access I'm sorry to which one job candidates oh yeah yeah no yeah yeah it's all good I'm not worried about that ryan um yeah send them to you now it's all good sweet so yeah like I said I could go I'm gonna go Right. Yeah, let us know because we need to cross-reference it. Okay, with Josh, I'm going to also attempt to get what he's for. Something like, oh, I walked away from the computer. No, what happened was I had the phone in my hand, and I walked away, and I forgot you're hearing me through the computer. What I was saying is we need to cross-reference what you find with, do those industries like have people we can get visas for. Say, for example, like nurses can be tough to get these type of visas for us because they don't have awards or they don't do publications and stuff like that, you know? So it might be. Well, I'll tell you, I'm going to go after your question. So it's going to be, you know, Perfect. Yeah, that'll work great. That'll work great. Yeah. I'll give you access to these. So I'll give you access to the job candidate where we put like, you know, all the people come in so you can see what type of people they are. And then I'll give you access to this sheet, which is where we've been looking for the employers that we were targeting. I'm going to basically break down all the jobs that have been open for a long time. Then I'm going to figure out who is doing this, exactly who is at the end of those jobs. Not leaving the job poster. I see. Got you. I'll build a list of those folks. And then I will set up a campaign to target them each 10 to 15 times over a 45-day period. And then I'll do events. But maybe half of them will be actual LinkedIn messages. But some of them will be, like, postings. Like, they'll follow their... Or, like, I'll get into their world. Awesome. I love it. I think this might be a good match between our skillset. I'm really excited to see somebody go through the process. I just want to see it work. Yes, sir. That we all do. All right. Well, I feel like I have everything I need. Is there a team that calls? I do not call this. No, not right now. Anybody's up in game. Yeah. Cool. Let's build those jobs. Let's build those companies. Let's build those decision makers. And then once I have a script that's going into a campaign, I'll share that with you. It'll be like, You know, day one connection request, two days after that, a message, three days after that, maybe an email. And then if they connect with me, they go down this path. And it'll be just different types of content getting me into their algorithm. Gotcha. In the meantime, I like your approach of like, jumping in like changing our branding from subscription uh to something out like you know something else and then also coming with the idea like we're bringing yes and like leading with the sports thing like hey the same thing that the sports you know have been doing is the same thing that you know that you can do but something like that yeah you lost me oh can you hear me now All right. I was saying I was going to kind of focus to rebranding on leading with the sports, like the same thing that the highest level sports thing, you know, companies are doing the same thing that you can do in your business. Something like that. Yeah. We're in and out there a little bit, but what you're basically saying is leading with the sports thing and talking about proven concepts being applied, pitching that first. Correct. You're done. I know it's going to sound insane, but maybe a little bit, I don't know, like you wouldn't even consider it as a factor, but just stick with me for a second here. And I'm not trying to judge anyone, but have you been in corporate America all that much? No. You have sort of a picture in your head of who might be the HR person. in a specific company or any company. I see. Yep. It's not going to be your company. No. Let's see. There are a lot of new jobs in the market. Okay. The industry term is kind of a silly thing that people have around HR. It's kind of a jokey thing that people say. If you ever go to the term conference, for instance, you're going to return to an HR organization. That I'm not. So at HR and MBA, it's the certification you need to be an HR person. I've never been in HR, but I've been sold to them and dealt with them my whole career. The Sherm Conference is 95% HR bars, and then there's like 5% me walking around. It's unbelievable how humongous the pool is. It's kind of crazy. I mean, there's Every single company has an HR team, right? There's not too many HR dudes, and the fact that there are some, they're usually not, they're not gonna be the alpha type. I don't know very many alpha type people, men or women, that end up leading HR. It just doesn't happen very much. I think the issue there is it's been over the years traditionally sort of a touchy-feely role, or at least it's gotten that way in corporate America, but it's finally getting a seat Sort of like marketing was this kind of artsy-fartsy thing before they had real research and data. You know, in the Don Draper days, it was some kind of media, excuse me, artwork, and then it was, but now marketing is data-driven, right? Yeah. HR has been working through the renaissance of that for the last 10 years. Our technology has received huge CEC investment, like 20 times what it, I think there's been a, a white paper that I can share with you that, I forget exactly what it was, but it was like 20 times the investment in HR tech in 2021 and 22 than there were the previous 20 years combined. Like it's just this huge boom in investment in HR as a strategic business unit. But we have at home, for the most part, they haven't really had a seat at the boardroom table. They're just starting to get The reason I'm saying all of this is fresh new ideas matter a whole lot, and new ones matter a whole lot. Leading with the, we're applying what top talent agencies and sports agencies do. We're applying that to corporate America. Yeah. And it's the fresh one that they've never had. This is H.R. Barb's chance to stand up in the quarterly business review and tell the CEO, I I like the way you phrased that, too. The way you said it is better than the way I said it. What about your recording, sir? Yeah, right. Just don't ever share that that was me saying it. I'm not trying to be prejudiced against anybody. It is just absolute stereotypes just for a reason. You can go into any Fortune 500 company, and for the most part, there's an older or middle-aged woman leading you in charge. yeah understood understood so I like this pitch a lot because I think it just it makes their eyes pop they have this new thing that it's it's not retained it's not contingency and it's not some weird version of that rpo word of rpo sourcing yes um but like That was sort of a sexy model. Like 10 years ago, you could outsource your recruitment department and they would parse it out and all the component parts of the recruitment process. And then they would charge you for each individual little part. Okay. Phone interviews this month, blah, blah. So at the time that was a big thing for an HR person that was just getting their seat at the table. I think this is a new one. And I think leading with that is going to register with the right kind of folks. Yeah. I agree. I agree. I'm going to switch myself on the website probably to reflect that. I appreciate your candor and my flexibility on this. It's very cool. We're just trying to win. Just trying to win and no ego in it. All right. Cool. If you need anything else, let me know. If you need a PDF flyer or anything like that or just a question about the back end, how it works. Right now we're redeveloping the kind of contracts. So over the next two days, what I was working on is revamping the kind of proposals and contracts happen after like the meeting happens. So when they're ready to close. So I'll probably introduce that to you as like, you know, to get your feedback on that, to, you know, make sure it's something that will be helpful rather than distracting for when we are trying to actually close the clients, give them to sign the contract. I want to hear all your YouTube videos. I like those, like short little bite-sized, frequently asked questions, answers pretty much. Anything else like that, a one-pager of FAQs, that might be pretty useful. That's only if I get a bite, but it's a nibble. For the most part, I don't really need any collateral. I'm not doing email yet. No text, no Facebook, no Instagram. Yeah, I got you. No problem. Yeah. All right. Well, good to go. Let's get started. All right. Sounds good. Talk to you soon. Peace.",,,,,

Now, what I want to see now is why we're contacting them and making sure that they understand the opportunity and it involves moving to the United States. Did you want to go ahead and look at resumes now? We'll send them over to you for the ones we deem. a good candidate and just kind of get feedback from you on how you would be best for the process to go to ensure quick visa applications and presentation of the candidates to the powers that be. So I did a video because it's more context and look forward to get feedback from you. Thank you very much.",,,,,

How's it going? This is Sherrod Seward of Innovative Global Talent Agency. I hope that you are having a great evening. I am contacting you and making this video because I think I've identified something that is a great need at this organization and that you'd be very good at since you are a very diligent person and a very caring person that knows people's stories. One of the things that we have going on is that we have job placement. Job placement. that are going to be going all over the world and they're going to be used to create a well it's already kind of creating it um but we have a lot of people that are applying for jobs looking to be placed see job candidate tracking so I'm sharing my screen with you kind of show so this And this, so we have a lot of jobs on LinkedIn. We have jobs on Indeed that are eventually brought into this spreadsheet, which is going to then go into a customer relationship management situation. The thing that I think you'd be very good at, especially once you're kind of coached on what it takes to get an O-1 visa, is I think that you can go through these candidates and identify who is a good candidate that can get an O-1 visa and who is not. That's gonna be extremely invaluable because we have a lot of candidates coming through and we need somebody diligent and intelligent and with the time to do it right. to go and mark and indicate if people are likely good for an O-1 visa or not. What we're committed to doing is showing you, one, a good place to educate you on how to know if somebody is a good candidate or not from candidate sheets. and then also give you a steady support that you need to do training. So what I'm going to do is send you a video of me going through some candidates for a teaching job so you can kind of see why I identified some people as good candidates for O-1 visa and not. And I'll also send you a video of another attorney that has done a lot of playlists on who's a good O-1 visa candidate or not. But I hope you find this interesting and intriguing. And if you do it, we'll try to figure out some way to get you paid for it, because this is an extremely important part of the business. And I think you are the one that can do it. All right.

Very excited to get here. This is ongoing support and professional development. It's very important that that we look at each other as a team. While we might have individual goals and individual markets and individual aspirations that we're all working for, together, we don't have to do it in a silo. And also together, I believe that we do a much better job as developing as professionals and just getting a lot of feedback and energy from the solutions that we're going to provide to people as a team. All right. So I just wanted to go over a few things to one, let you know that we do have marketing assets and we are committed to making new tailored marketing assets as we go forward to be specifically tailored to what you need in your location and the type of prospects that you are coming across in your network. Second is we're going to do biweekly or weekly training sessions that we'll try to get at a time where most people can participate as everybody's all over the world. But even if we can't, be sure to send your inquiries, feedback, success to roland.seward at innovativeglobaltalent.com so that we can incorporate those into those sessions, even if you're unable to attend. And of course, we'll make those available by video. Afterwards, so you can see those as ongoing training. The thing is, we want to use the past interactions that everybody's seeing in the field as they talk to clients and talent to see what they like about the program, what they're hesitant about the program. And then as they are getting into the program, keep contact with them for good reviews and good referral sources. And next is keep us abreast of industry trends that you're seeing in your country. so that we can maybe apply that to other places around the world that might not have that happen yet. Since we are all over the place, we can be taking advantage of that momentum and applying that knowledge base in places where it might not happen yet. That's one of the fun things about this. So going forward, let me know let the team know what times of the day or night um and day of the week look good for you for doing the bi-weekly um training or the weekly training just so that we can try to team up and figure something where we can get most of the people and the most value out of that and combination training. So thank you for taking full advantage of this module. I think with this, you'll be in a good spot to move forward and be an asset to this organization and also make some good compensation for your family. Looking forward to working with you.

I think it's going along pretty good and we're getting towards the end of it because this is a simple, simple thing, even though it's very important. And we try to make it so it's easily digestible how to get started and how to continue. And we're going to be growing throughout this. So this one is advanced techniques in business development. The one reason why everybody was picked out of the people that were interested in being a part of this is I like the intuitive thinking that is reflected in our talent base for business development. I know that we have a lot of smart people here that have used that intelligence to create great relationships and use that to know how quickly you can make quite a bit of money here with a little bit of time by using that intelligence and that network. So with that, we don't have to do this in a silo. The best advanced technique for business development is sharing ideas. We want your ideas. We don't just want you doing what I say to do or what some of the other executives say what to do. We invite you to always, always feel like you can contribute your thoughts to the organization as we can always get better. And we can always support your individual specific efforts in the business development. So that's part number one. Be sure to introduce your new ideas. To do that, you can send them to Roland Seward, who is roland.seward at Innovative Global Talent Agency. And I'll include his email as part of the links below the text with this. Also, be free and encouraged to go out and do your own thing. You can absolutely place your own job placements As you get ideas, you don't have to wait for us to do that. And just let us know how those candidates work out. You are empowered to do so. The next is, of course, you'll need background materials to help you in your endeavors. So we do have some really good marketing professionals that are good at making PDF materials, making blogs. I'll go and make videos if you need them to support you as well. So if you do have marketing materials that you need made, do not hesitate to email digitalmedia at oaklg.com. That's Franz. That's digitalmedia at oaklg.com. And the gentleman's name that does that is Franz. And we'll be sure to organize ourselves to quickly get those materials to you and the language that you need them. Well, videos might be hard, but definitely the written ones and the blog posts. so that you can lean on those assets to help you be successful as you go out to clients and try to get them to participate in the executive placement program. Finally, always be sure to give your weekly insight on kind of what you're seeing in the market. as you go and talk to clients and give us that feedback so we can always do our reoccurring meetings and address those rebuttals and questions clients might have before getting started. We're always looking to fine tune our messaging across the organization to be successful all over the world. Thank you very much.",,,,,

Keeping a well manicured pipeline and a way to communicate with them is very important, especially when we have several persons in the organization always working to make sure we're doing our best of bringing in new clients. and revenue to the business and everybody involved. And so it's going to be important that we are all on the same page when it comes to how we talk to clients and how we document that we talk to clients. As you know, from the previous module, we are currently in the advanced stages of inserting a CRM, customer relationship management tool, that's going to help us a lot with keeping track of everything. And that's going to be HubSpot. More than likely, and it's going to be done hopefully in the next week or less of us doing this video. But in the meantime, we do have a way to keep track of things. For now, as you have candidates, you should be looking at your current network that you have. And what you need to do is make sure that they input your name when they're filling out their candidate sheets. If they schedule a consultation, we already know kind of where they're coming from and you'll be sure to get credit for that once things close. Also, when you do have contact with a candidate, Be sure just to send a note about what happened and who it was to CRM at Innovative Global Talent dot com. That's CRM at Innovative Global Talent dot com. What that does is send a message back to our internal place that we'll use to update the spreadsheets that will populate and be the lifeblood of our CRM tool. OK, so when you talk to someone, even though we don't have the CRM tool ready yet, just send an email to CRM at InnovativeGlobalTalent.com and that will give you the news and that will allow us to update what was the last conversation. Make sure that you get credit for when you talk to clients and things of that nature. In addition, when that client is input into our CRM system, we do have a way to follow up with them with custom messages, just to make sure that we're touching base with them on an automatic way so that you don't be responsible for always just following up without anything happening. That being said, sometimes it does take more than one conversation to get someone comfortable with the program. So do stay on top of your pipeline with hitting them up contacting them, but we also will have an automated system for sending them messages just to encourage them to look back at some of the success stories, answer common questions, and even encourage them to schedule a consultation if they want specific feedback on their situation to participate in the executive placement program. So as a follow-up, I'll include a link to the email that you can send your candidates that you're talking to I'm going to try to put a hubspot demo so you can start to get familiar with how the upcoming crm system will work and then as a reminder we do have an automatic way to follow up with candidates as they are input into our crm program thank you very much",,,,,

Module 4 is an important one, which is how to locate, identify and engage prospective clients. These are the important thing of what we're doing here. We need to know how to find the best people in the world at the industries that we want to participate in our executive placement program. The first place to start is you were chosen in particular because you have a great network and you've already done so much marvelous things in your career and industry and I'm sure that as you've come across different people and different projects and different businesses and employment opportunities you know people that are highly motivated to do great in their industry and apply their skill set and even maybe bring their families to the united states That's the first place that you start. Just spark up the conversation with them about how you're now associated with Innovative Global Talent Agency and then invite them to fill a candidate sheet that says, hey, you never know. This might be something that you are great at and likely to do. And this is even for people that might be in school in the United States and getting ready to graduate and maybe do not have a job offer or maybe have a job offer where the employer does not want to sponsor the person. In this case, we can, one, talk to the employer to let them know about our program and maybe sign up in the future as a subscribed employer for Innovative Global Talent Agency. And then we can maybe work with that foreign national to serve as their petitioner IGTA on an agent basis and facilitate their O-1 visa to work with their employer and several employers after that with the flexibility that we can give them. So the first part is leveraging your existing network. And I'm going to share my screen now so we can talk about some of the other ways we can do this. One thing is we want your feedback on to how we can place jobs that are in the description of your best skill set in the countries and locations that you're best suited and comfortable with speaking to. For example, if you know blockchain in Hong Kong, Help us know where is the best place to place a job or we can give you job descriptions to put in your own LinkedIn to start getting candidates. And that's the other part. Once we get candidates coming in, we'll go ahead and give you access to the back end of those job descriptions, such as what's happening here. Then also these job descriptions are placed on a candidate sheet here. Now, this is a stack, a job stack that keeps all the candidates that come into us, it gets their resumes, and it also gives a place for feedback on them. Now, we do not want to give you access to this because it's kind of bulky. Instead, we're going to onboard a customer relationship management system that will keep track of all the candidates in one system that's easy to access. Candidates pull them up, make notes, and for everybody in the organization to be able to track who's contacted them last, where they are in the process, if they have candidate sheets. and stuff of that nature, something to make it very, very streamlined. So to help you, one, go through your own network, tell people about it. Two, give us ideas on the type of job placements and where to put those job placements so that we can get more candidates coming in that are qualified for you to prospect. Third, we'll have a customer relationship management system, probably HubSpot, that will take the information from this Google sheet and make it real time into being able to pull candidates and to see what the current process is with bringing them on board as an executive placement candidate. Next, we also have lists that we have made of people that are great candidates already because we know that they have award-winning STEM and AI accolades. And you can see these people come from all over the world. And feel free to reach out to these persons directly and just mark that you spoke to them as you try to get them to be an executive placement candidate. We also sometimes go and see who has been working in different kinds of competitions around the world where people do hackathons. For example, these LeetCode contacts is another great source of potential good candidates for the executive placement. And these contacts will also be part of the example of candidates you can reference and pitch that we already have gathered their contact information. So to reiterate, The first place to find great candidates is your own network. Just have them fill out a candidate sheet or a scheduled consultation, and we'll see if they're a great fit for the program. Second is let us know where and what type of job postings to put to make more candidates come into our talent pool to which you'll get access to through the customer relationship management system. And then second, we always are looking actively for award-winning persons in the industry we like to approach them about participating in the program. You can have access about reaching out to them too. Thank you very much.",,,,,

Now, when we're talking about this, we're not expecting you to know exactly who is qualified for an O-1 visa or not because you're not an immigration attorney and we don't expect you to be one. But we do think that you can get pretty adept and educated in being able to tell who's definitely not. For a person that is not at the highest level of their field or maybe hasn't Contributed to great products or they're just getting started. They're probably not the best candidate for the 01. Nonetheless, even if you're not sure, it's OK to send somebody a candidate sheet. There's no harm in having them fill it out and having us give them a good evaluation on whether they are or not. but they're sometimes obvious when somebody's not qualified, such as somebody that's just starting in their career, somebody that's at the lower entry level of an organization, or maybe somebody that's just mid-tier but hasn't done anything to stand out and they're in an industry where it might not kind of make sense. For example, nursing can be tough because they usually don't get original awards themselves, but if they did, then potentially they are a good O-1 candidate. When we're talking about 01 candidates, we're looking for people that have won awards themselves, people that work for companies that have won awards and they've been a significant contributor to that. We're looking for people that have contributed to projects that have went on to win awards in which they were significant contributors to those projects. We're also looking for people in industries where they might give leeway, even if they haven't got those, but they're in STEM, they're in data learning. They're in machine learning. They're in computer science. Stuff of those highly talented industries where USCIS knows that America needs more of these talents and may be willing to stretch it. But when in doubt, don't hesitate to give somebody a candidate sheet and encourage them to fill that out so we can get the evaluations going. We do have people in the back end that look at these evaluations. but we still wanna provide training to our business development consultants to know who's a good candidate versus not through examples. So that way you also don't waste your time speaking to candidates that have no chance of getting the O-1 because our whole business is based off the O-1 visa. potentially. And we'll continue to do weekly trainings on who's a good candidate versus who is not. Now, if we do a candidate evaluation and somebody is not an O-1 visa eligible, we do have something as an alternative we can offer them through one of our partners through the H-1B program. So if we come and determine that somebody is not a good candidate for O-1, don't immediately just tell them that there's no hope. Have them fill out our alternative option sheet, which I will put in here when it's available. At the time I'm doing this video, it's not quite ready, but it'll be ready soon. And with the course, the link should be there that you can send candidates that are not good for 01, or we've come back with feedback that said that this option is probably not the best. We'll give them this alternative option to look for. So I'm See if there's anything there that's there. So you can expect with this part of the course that I'll give you an eligibility playlist from an attorney I like a lot that has a lot of videos on eligibility for 01. You'll get to see a video from me personally going through resumes of teachers saying who's a good candidate, who's not, and who's in the middle. And then you'll also eventually get a link for a referral option for non-qualified applicants. that can get another chance to another category with a partner that we do business with. So that's module three. Be sure to look at the links associated with it so you can get your product knowledge up. Thank you very much.",,,,,
Aug.26.2024,IGTA - Executive Placement Program Module 2 - Module 2_ Understanding the Executive Placement Proces.mp4,IGTA,IGTA - Executive Placement Program Module 2 - Module 2_ Understanding the Executive Placement Proces,IGTA - Executive Placement Program Module 2 - Module 2_ Understanding the Executive Placement Proces.mp4,IGTA - Executive Placement Program Module 2 - Module 2_ Understanding the Executive Placement Proces.mp3,"Welcome to module two, sorry, and this is understanding the executive placement process. When we're talking about executive placements, what that means is that a foreign national can pay us a fee of $15,000, which will include a 01 visa application and priority placement in our talent pool. Traditionally, if we choose people for our talent pool without them coming to us, they'll have to wait for their visa application to be filed and they also will have to wait for an opportunity to come up before we kind of push them to the front of the line when it comes to job placement. But that's not the case for the executive placement. For the fee, they get the O-1 package for themselves on regular processing, and they also get the priority initiative when it comes to placing them as soon as possible with the job in the United States with one of our employer partners. Now, the O-1 is a highly, highly coveted visa. And typically someone would have to pay that money to an attorney just by itself and have a job offer to get one. So it's a tremendous value to the candidate to participate in this program because they're going to get 01 servicing from some of the best attorneys in the nation. When it comes to 01 visa, they're going to get a petitioner service and priority when it comes to placement in the pool of talent. The other thing is managing expectations of how that process looks like and what it means for you to get people into the program. So when you have a candidate, basically you want to, of course, tell them what the program includes, go to the website, show them our past performance, and then they can do one of two things. The best thing they can do, which is absolutely free, is fill out a candidate sheet with as much information as possible about certain questions that will tell us if they're a good candidate for the 01. Because we do not want to take on individuals who are not a good candidate and just take their money for no reason if we know they're not eligible. We want to make sure that they are eligible for this type of visa, right? The other thing they can do is they can schedule a consultation with an attorney. Because we have a relationship with an immigration law firm, we do have access to reduced fee consultations that a candidate can use to ask questions about both the visa and the process. The links to the candidate sheet will be provided to you. And if you need it in a certain language, just let us know and we'll make that happen. That is the same with the consultation. The link will be provided to you. And the consultation will probably cost around $100 to $150. And that's just so we know that candidates are serious. Otherwise, they might get a lot of time wasted for candidates that are not all that serious about moving forward. But they always can fill out a candidate sheet. And if they do it well, we'll give them honest feedback on whether they are a good fit for the program or if they are not. The next thing is managing expectations of what happens. Once a candidate does choose to be a participant in the program, they'll have a contract to sign and an invoice to pay. This will be also provided in a link that'll be easy for you to present to clients. And then we'll also we'll know when somebody is referred by you comes to us because there'll be an option in the contract to mark who is the person that you are working for with to get this opportunity. The next thing they'll probably want to know is how long does the process take? Well, on regular processing, once the visa is filed, it'll probably take us a month or two to file it and get out the door. Then there is a three to four month usual waiting time to get feedback from USCIS on regular processing. we do have the opportunity for candidates to pay an additional government fee to get premium processing when this happens the response time on the visa applications will be much shorter which is 15 business days or less when uscis must respond to the question now in the worst case scenario if a visa is denied typically what will happen is we'll look at it on a case-by-case basis And our goal is to always refile the visa to see if there's any kind of thing we missed in filing it, or if we got a bad officer with USCIS that gave us an unfair decision. But usually we're very careful about who we pick for the program. And so it's usually something abnormal if something gets denied and it's something that can be easily fixed with a filing of a new visa. And we're always looking for feedback to see how to make this program much more attractive to the candidates, easier for our business development consultants to pitch, and for the process just to feel better for everybody involved. And to do this, we'll provide the links, like we said, to the candidate sheet. If you need a different type of language, let us know. We'll provide a link to where they can schedule a consultation with an attorney at a reduced rate. And we'll also have the link to where you can have them do a contract once you have candidates that are interested. and any type of questions that you have, please do not hesitate to contact the staff so we can incorporate that and make sure that you're well supported with that. Thank you very much.",,,,,

It's me, Sherrod Seward. And if you're getting this, you're starting your journey as an executive placement business development consultant with International Global Talent Agency. And we're so glad to have you. And in this module, we're just going to give you an introduction to the executive placement program and give you some background on Innovative Global Talent Agency. So first, what I'll do is kind of show you the website, where is the basis of what we do. So our story is, again, we are founded by immigration attorneys that have had a lot of success doing O1 visas for some of the best athletes, entertainment, and then lately business people in the world on this specialty visa. The O1 visa is the highest level of non-immigrant, meaning it doesn't come with a green card, but it can lead to one. visa that one can get into the United States. And the thing that's great about it is you can come with immigrant intent, meaning you can go to the consulate and say, I plan to live in the United States forever. And they will not deny you because the O-1 visa is that coveted. And the other thing is it has a great work authorization, which pretty much means you can work for various jobs on the same visa where it's structured properly. And that's what we do. We use the agent-based system to file 401 visas for the best talent from around the world, and then actively shop them for placement in the United States with our employment partners. At our website, if you go to the homepage, This is kind of where we learned the business from one fighting championship in Singapore, the NBA G League. We learned it in sports with some of the best and top tier organizations in the world. And what we're doing now is applying the same concept that we've known for the past seven years with a lot of success to other categories that we find very advantageous to employers here in the United States. All right. So that's our mission. Our mission is to locate and engage the best talent from around the world in the industries that are important and needed in the United States. Get them O-1 visas with us serving as the petitioner. and we leave the employer out of the whole process. So for a person that likes or is looking to work in the United States, what we do is they engage with us, we'll get them a visa, and we'll also place them with a job. In the meantime, before they have the job, while they're getting their visa process, we'll work with them to have an itinerary where they can do things with our agency to keep them going until they have the employment. That'd be various commission based activities or just project notoriety based activities. All right. And right now we're looking for international professionals in tech, blockchain, farm tech, semiconductors. looking at culinary artists, definitely in the medical field too. So there's a wide range of the talent that we can get. And we're excited that you can engage your network to help people gain access to the United States and earn a pretty good living while they're doing it too.",,,,,

I am following up with good news. We have candidates. I was running three LinkedIn jobs in Madrid, Mexico City and Buenos Aires. And I just cycled through about one hundred twenty something applicants and found some that are good for the teaching job. So the job description was basically like we're looking for a prestigious multilingual opportunity. It's advertised in the city that the job post is in, but the job post says that the job is in American rural Georgia. So everybody knows that. All right. So the next step is just to contact them. One, try to get them to fill in the candidate sheet. I'll give you the link for that. Two is to make sure they understand that this is an urgent need for teachers in rural Georgia that comes probably with relocation, good benefits in us getting the O-one visa. It's imperative that they see if they're available for a interview as soon as possible and fill out the candidate sheet so we can be sure that they're good for the O-one visa. And that's pretty much it. I have a list I'll show you. Well, let me show you the email. I do. I do. I do. All right. So this is the email I'm going to send you. I'm going to send you this video. It's going to be right here. Here's a list of me going through the candidates. And these are the people and contact information. The persons that I said are great candidates. And like in the big video, I'll show you why they're great candidates. And here's some resumes of like the whole list of people to call and tell that thing. So. If you do have a chance to call them, let's get them on board for next week. Now, I arranged a situation with Wayne that we actually get a lot more money on if it just goes to the law firm. I'll explain that later. But we can get paid off this. All right. Peace.",,,,,

Now, since it's such short notice, I'm going to be kind of breezing through these, not looking to see exactly if they have a one eligibility, but we're going to send them a message and let them tell us by filling out a candidate sheet. All right. So one thing I do is I put all of this, even if this is not a good fit. I go and put them. Put them here. Right. Okay, so let's start to go through it. Let me put this down so I'll get the check. All right. So let's say at least they're a professor of English. So that looks good. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to, so it says short notice. We're going to have to send, they're going to have to fill out a candidate sheet and do some homework. We're not going to call them right away, but if they are good, we are like, they're already a professor. We are going to download their resume so we can present that to the client, even though we haven't made contact with them. So I have a message that's already ready to send. I don't know. I said, okay, there it goes. Keep that on. Boom. We're also going to. You scroll down, they should have a resume there. Download it. All right, let's go to the next person. It seems like this person's in the United States. Let's see if they have any type of teaching experience. Zero teaching experience. I don't think they'll be able to work in the school district, so we're going to skip them. Well, at least they're here in the United States. Let's look at him. Well, it seems like, wait, hold on. Is this the right person? I can't tell where he is. I'll go skip him. He looks kind of shady. Yvonne. Let's kind of scroll down. How many work do you have experience with elementary? So he does have some education. Contract administrator. He's not gonna work for us. Let's go to the next one. Lead project manager, teacher of English at English bites, English tutor. We like this. Um, so it's down his oops. I'll save that. All right. And then send him a message, sending him a message because he's already an English teacher. In a different country, which maybe we can show that he's very good at teaching English in South America. And some might give. Or way back to another one. Send a message downloaded the resume. Account executive. How many years do you have with elementary one? see the resume show more for beginning a beginning english educator freelance english teacher she's not going to get us there yeah so I'm going to skip her she's not going to get us there because she's just a freelance kind of starting out teacher let's go to show more commercial assistant no teaching stuff moving on resume very well curated BA in English with ten years of experience teaching history linguistics primary teacher all right so Download. And we'll message her. Maybe she has more behind her than we know. She might have won some awards, had some famous peoples. We're not sure. We'll let her tell us. All right, moving on down. foreign language teacher. That's a positive. This is in Spanish. Well, she's a teacher, so. And we're not going to download her resume because it's in Spanish. and we're not gonna send our clients something in Spanish like we didn't have time to translate it. That would look sloppy. All right, so who was that? Moving on down, Fulbright Fellow. Now, we are talking about something right here. If somebody is a Fulbright Fellow, that's something we can definitely use for a O-one visa application and she has a PhD. So this person, we're actually going to put down to call. So let me make a whole nother thing over here. We got one. Actually, I'm just gonna for sake of time, I'll just log in stuff. I'm gonna put them on another screen. You guys can't see, but just know that I put her down to be called. Definitely, I don't know. Definitely downloading her resume. What is her name? I think her name was Maria Amalo. All right, fellow, and a PhD. Boy, is she ready. So let's message her. She has a PhD of Philosophy in English, Master of Arts. Oh my God. We might've did it. Oops. She's a King Kong enthusiast. I don't even know what that means. Don't even know what that means, but it looks exciting. Okay, again, we liked her because she's at the PhD level. She's willing to relocate. She has a doctorate in philosophy and English, which we can use to argue that she's one of the best English speakers and teachers of English in her country. And she's a Fulbright scholar. So she's definitely getting a call. Learning program. Let's go to the next person. Antonina. Antonella. Let's look at this resume. An oral learning specialist with Cognizant. I didn't know Cognizant was an e-learning specialist. Technology lab assistant. Instructional design. Let's see what her big numbers say. She has a lot of... She's gonna have to fill out something. She's gonna have to tell us. We like e-learning. Let's see if she's won some awards. She's gonna have to do some homework. All right, Virginia Marquez. Look at this, eighteen years of elementary experience, native or bilingual in Spanish, native or bilingual in English. Let's look at this resume, gotta download it. It's a document, so we can't really see it like that. So instead, we're going to look at her full profile. A new tab. Bam. New tab. What's up? Let's translate this to English so I know what's going on. She's an English teacher. There's not a lot here. Okay. She's worked as an English teacher in rural and urban public schools. I don't know if that's gonna be enough for no one, but we are gonna send her a message. Oh, I didn't get that. So it's important not to press, Answer before you hit the format, correct? American School of Angola. A serious resume. She's Venezuelan. Series. Venezuela. I don't know if it's good enough for an O-one, but we're going to send her a message. Put her to a maybe. Okay. Probably formatted. Press return. I'm not going to send her resume over. because it didn't look as anything that's worthy of the O-one, so we didn't want to get them excited. English teacher. Some English secondary school. Only three years of experience. Once an interpreter. Or a doctor for medical. United Emirates. Let's have her send some stuff out. But yeah, it looks like she is a flight attendant for United Emirates. Well, not United Emirates, but the Emirates. But we'll give her a shot. Put her information. Not taking down her resume. Muhammad. They're saying he's not a fit because he's an English. Let's go look. Degree, master's in chemistry. Okay. So he's a science teacher in Pakistan. Let's see, does he speak Spanish? There's no level of Spanish. Does he speak English? Native or bilingual? I always message him. Let him fill out an intake sheet and see if something comes of it. Let me put a timeout. I'm gonna put a quick timeout and come. Oh, we started recording. I found somebody that was very good. So we found Ricardo Ramirez. Let's see what we like about him. When we say rhetoric and composition, which is a sign of sophistication, mass degrees, But watch this. He's in blockchain, faculty of economics. He's worked for a law firm. Now, but when we start getting here, he's attended conferences. Look at his paper presentations, publications. Right here, good publications. We love that. He has international examinations that he's done. And here we have awards, a scholarship from the Department of State, and he's a Fulbright scholar as well. So I think that he is a great candidate for the O-one visa for sure, for sure. Someone pause till I find another one. Well, I guess we can kind of keep going. So what I did is I sent him, well, I'm going to send him a message and I put him down to give a phone call. As you can see, I had stuff there. So let me get the little script that we have. Then I'm going to kind of pause the recording, not make it so long until we find somebody else, because I think we've seen a lot of examples of why somebody doesn't necessarily fit, but we give them a chance to fill out their candidate, candidate sheet. That should be fine. So let's go and send. Send, we press return. Okay. I'm pause recording until I find somebody good. Okay. Here we found one. That's pretty interesting. Josephina. Um, she's interesting because she's an entrepreneur, English language teacher, Spanish teacher freelance. Right. But when I look at her things, it looks like she has Citibank, all these people here. So we can look at her as a person that has a lot of, um, Ruth prize or best dissertation university of Wales. so she has some accolades there that we can maybe work with so we're definitely going to take down her resume to send to the client okay so go ahead send that we're also going to take down her contact information for a call which would be here oops Josephina Reynolds. On to my colleagues. OK. And I think we already sent her the message, yeah, so she's good to go. I'll let you know when I find another one that's good and explain why. OK, I found another candidate that's good, this Maria. Let's go to her. See full profile. All right, we like her because she has a specialty, which is in cognitive simultaneous interpretation as a freelancer. And she has a lot of experience as an English teacher. So she's been an English teacher. She's been an English teacher for ten years. Oh, she went to Sacred Heart, English transfer, okay. Sharon is Spanish. All right, so maybe you can see it here. Oh, let's go back. Yeah, let's go back to her resume. Show more. This is not going to see this, but she's a conference interpreter. ESL teacher. So that conference interpreter, that's a unique skill that's there, especially in those two languages. So that's kind of what I'm basing it off of for her. I took down her resume, and we're going to give her a call. So I'll pause until we find the next one. We have another one. Let me show you why. First, we go down. We see that they have the basics. Conversational English, that's fine. Bilingual Spanish, good. But look at this profile he has. One, he is a leading internet and internalization projects for companies so he has some business background with that um we also like that he oh let's go find him again see where he's at all right so that we can see that he has a publication so available he has a phd in business and social sciences postgraduate degrees just a lot going on here And he might even have a social media presence would be great too. We can get them under O one B, but he has the professor of international marketing module. She sent, um, university of Buenos Aires, associate professor, professor of market research and stuff. So he's a PhD in business and social science. I'm pretty sure that we can look into getting him the O one visa. So you'd be great. So we're definitely going to download his resume. Um, which is right, where is he? He's over here. So let's download this one, even though it's in Spanish or Italian. What's his name? Chuanma Fernandez. Okay. So that's great. Got him. Let's take down his contact information. I'm gonna put that in the here. Okay. Then we're gonna send him the message and he's gonna call tomorrow or today. depending if I can arrange that to happen. All right, so let's send him a message. So it's not a good fit because it's just in the wrong place. So I'll put maybe, I should put good fit. Enter, send, and I'm going to pause this recording. So it doesn't waste your time with stuff you don't want to see. Here's another one we like. Now we're in Mexico City looking at results. Now remember, we want to also put ones that are not a good fit so we can see people from other places that applied. So this one is a professor. Her resume is right here. So she's an ethics and social studies professor at the university level. Master of Family Sciences. They didn't say anything about like certificates and things like that. So we're just going to message her. We're not going to, we're not going to, we're going to take her off the call list. We're just going to send her a message because it's not clear that she's eligible for the L-one. It is good fit. Okay. It's not letting us message. Great. So let's open that a new tab. Hey, that's the reason. Close that. Let's grab our message. I'm going to keep this up because I think the next one behind them might actually be. All right, cool. So we can message them. All right. So we send that out. Let's go to this next person. It says they're not a fit because they're in Nicaragua, which is not in the market that we were in. Gee whizzers. We get a lot of glitches with the program. Okay, so we got him right here. Let's see what he has. So he's currently a curriculum special at the International Academy, senior instructional design and curriculum developer. That is good. That is really good because it's very specialized. You know, there's a lot of people out there that are saying they're a Fulbright alumni and a instructional designer. Oh, an instructional designer. Yeah, let's go. I like it. So let's get a little deeper. Fulbright scholar, went to Syracuse, credentials in STEM. Oh, yes, this is what we need. Oh, he's making courses. This is what we need. That's not him. That's him down here. All right, so he's right here. So let's grab him. He's a better candidate than the other one. Fulbright, seventy-five. We like Fulbrights. So let's go ahead and grab his resume. Download it. Uh, Nicaragua, great and a day or a wine visa. Okay. Beautiful. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna pause it here until we find another one. That's good. So next we have one that's a, maybe this is this Anna Malene. So eventually she was not a fit because she's in Serbia. But looking at it, she's a English business teacher with this We Fit group. And looking at her resume, she has a master's degree and she has a specialist in making educational experiences for immigrants. So we can call her kind of like a inclusion. implementing language education program. So language education for immigrants program person. So it's not readily clear that she's good for a one, but she could potentially be. So we're not going to take down her info, but if she happens to fill out the sheet and do a good job with it and we like it, then we can hit her back. It's an example of somebody that I'm not putting forward as calling, but I think they might have some something there. So we're gonna send a message and leave it at that. Okay, we're here with another applicant that was marked not a good fit. It's because they're only conversational in Spanish. But remember, this is an English-speaking school where they want them kind of both, so this is not a bad thing. But most importantly to us is like people that can get the L-I visa. this person is a doctoral student in chemistry and has plenty of experience with teaching so they might be really good with spanish level things and looking at their full thing you can see that they've been a lecturer they have a master's degree already they're in the doctorate program they've been a teacher a lecturer cambridge very very and a chemistry consultant. So they might have a lot of projects that they've worked on that have had commercial success. And I'm sure he might have even made some products or some type of processes himself. And he has a publications here. English and Spanish are his languages. So this looks pretty good for an O-one visa. So we're going to go ahead and put him down for being contacted. So then we'll go like this, remember his name, Nelson Itafo. Okay. So that's Nelson Itafo. All right. Nelson Itafo. We probably should put his... It's linked in there so it can be easily found. Let's actively contact him. Let's send him the message. This is great. We're getting some good candidates here. So he's a good fit. Let's message him. Place that with what we have. Make sure the formatting is good. Send it. All right. So I'm going to stop it until we find somebody else. Here we have another interesting candidate. I can't say that name. And so I don't want to try Mr. But we're going to send him a message, but not send him like contact them because we're not sure if we can get the the award, but look, he has memberships right here. Maybe this is a great thing as far as like working at a critical capacity, but here, this is where you can get, being a content editor and journalist freelance for Medium. From South Africa, Medium taps into the brains of the world's most insightful writers. thinkers by providing a platform where people can publish their academic, academic articles. The only thing is that they don't have a kind of gatekeeper to see why they're getting published. That might be not that good. So we want to have him definitely, um, do some more, um, homework, give them some homework. Um, but we're not going to contact them. Oh, wait a second. He went to Harvard university, university of arch. Oracles and Prophecies, Monash. I don't know what that is, but we definitely know what Harvard University is. It's Associated Arts. It might be an online course. He's only there for a year. But let's go ahead and give him the spiel and let him see if he's willing to do the homework. Okay. Great stuff. I'll get back if there's something interesting. We are here with another great candidate. I'm going to tell you why they're great. So originally, they didn't look good because they haven't done elementary school. But remember, this is K through eight, and they have a lot of vacancies. But this person, I'll show you why we like. Because in O-ones, you can look at judging competitions. You can use the accolades of your pupils of what they've done and also original contributions to the field. So here, they love STEM. worked in both private practice so she might have some good projects here she can use I also have secular experience in book publishing so she has publications now this is good work in a critical capacity in a depo book program nice now here look at this year after year my students compete in a national competition where people win and I'm an evaluator a judge of the baccalaureate I have experience with various subjects. Currently, I'm working on the consolidation of a very high-level watchmaking school. Oh, this is great. World-class educator. International Baccalaureate Organization. University professor. She has a master's degrees in economics. I think there's something we can do here. So we definitely want to reach out to this person. So again, I want to go back to her profile here. Download a resume. Let's go ahead and download this. Her name is Elena Zepeda. So maybe I can just copy that. So I put this. Bam. OK. So we got here and then, oh. Before we do that, we're going to send her a message. So we're going to mark down her contact information, put her at the bottom. Copy link address. Oh, looks like we don't need to. All right. And let's send her to Spiel. Oh, I'm on the wrong stuff. There we go, it's Messenger. All right, I'll let you know when I get another good one. All right, here we have something interesting. I think this person's actually American because one they're on expect.com living in Mexico city. They've already been a master teachers in public schools in San Francisco and Louisiana and California. And they went to grand Canyon and for a university. So maybe the case that they're just maybe looking to come work in the United States. So what I'll do is I'm not going to send them the message about filling everything out. I'm just going to put a note here in my notes that says they're American. Saying different. American. See if interested in working in rural. All right. So we'll get his contact information as well. But his is different because he doesn't need a visa or anything. And he, for all we know, might just think this is a remote job in Mexico City. He might not be looking to come back. But we're definitely going to grab this contact information and see what is what. But I imagine he is an American. And I think he's probably looking to stay. He doesn't understand that this is a job we have to relocate. But we'll contact him and see. All right, we're almost done here.",,,,,
Aug.24.2024,IGTA training Joshua,Training Video,IGTA training Joshua,IGTA training Joshua.mp4,IGTA training Joshua.mp3,"uh if I'm not speaking on topics because there's a lag and when it says it's recording I'm waiting for it to indicate that it started okay we have an indication joshua I hope I didn't get you too discouraged yesterday I'll give you some context of what the problem is the problem is we get a lot of job applicants right so if we go to job candidates we have all these candidates coming in right but I click this Okay. It's the ones to you come here too. All right. So actually it might not be that big of a big of an issue. Well, there is some issues still. I need to be able to get into these job postings that you made and be able to look at the candidates. Right. So if I go here, I looked at, um, well, here's my account. Right? I don't see the job. I don't think. Unless this is it. Why is it called business development consultant instead of the plastics thing? All right. So this is what I need. There's somebody that actively goes and puts these people into this spreadsheet that I'll show you here. And really, I really preferred that they did not say business development consultant as I put the job here as business development consultant plastic supply chain. That's the main reason I can't quickly identify what job this was about because this job title is incorrect. It's not what I set to put. Let's see if there's a reason for this. So, this is the job name. Right? Just simple stuff like that goes a long ways. Also, that's all right. But the problem is, There's a guy named Jibo that's supposed to log these. I don't think he logged the jobs that she posted because he can't see them. So I'll make it so that he can see them going forward. But for the applicants that are already in these jobs that are not logged, you may have to do them for now. And he'll get the ones that are coming in. Job candidate tracking right here, right? So each job post is supposed to have a tab. So all the way to the end. And I'm not sure that that is even happening. If it didn't, I'm going to fire him, probably. Probably. Probably. But you see, the problem is we have all this job posting, these job postings, and it may be the case that nobody has went and logged their candidates into the spreadsheet as I asked. So all these candidates for these jobs are just sitting here. There's five hundred of them. And they need to be logged. Right. They need to be logged. Yeah, see this business development consultant is too vague and we're not sure if we're getting plastics people. It also looks like we're not getting a lot of jobs from people overseas. All right. So that's the problem we're dealing with. I'll put you on notice so we can figure out how we can change this to get these candidates along. All right, peace.",,,,,

Chris Steininger, Actually. make tabs like this but make a new spreadsheet just make it a new spreadsheet for this that says university reach outs and if you already have the contacts on here then you can use those to get into it because we um but we want to make sure they're fresh so I want you to go for each of those when you do it go to my visa jobs get the contacts just like you did um for here but then I also want you to go and look up um the international student office so I'll go university of michigan national student office um contacts all right so here we got the international students here and um you can get staff but I want you to get the staff actually go on to linkedin too and find them so international student and scholar advisor so go get so get the faculty not students not dutifully students so you get matt priest and put them on there all right try to get two contacts from the student international student and the general contact to the international student office and what phone numbers so get to my visa jobs contacts that they have them and then get the international students contacts try to get email and phone number for those remember to alternate so do engineering then do ohio then do north carolina then go back to engineering to North Carolina, then Ohio. Make a new spreadsheet with tabs for each, for engineering, North Carolina, Ohio. Trusting you, this is a very important project, so make it the top priority. We know you'll do a good job. Thank you very much.",,,,,

We're just waiting for an indication because sometimes there's a lag that has started. All right. Innovative Global Talent Agency Module 8, Call to Action for Student Offices and Students. This one's going to be a little bit more nuanced than the last one because there's this one called Action. So if we're talking to the International Student Office, the call to action is still the same. A Calendly link to have a conversation with me for 15 minutes, no cost. And it's a link for that, that you'll have. So student offices is the same as talking to administration. I'm not going to charge them to talk to them. 15 minutes is the commitment we're looking for. There's a Calendly link that they can schedule that at their own time. Now, if we're talking to students, this is where it can be more nuanced. Ideally, so if a student office wants to see proof of something and they are like, can you talk to this student? Then we won't charge a student for talking to them or putting up the hoops. We'll just talk to them as part of closing business, right? But in generally, we don't wanna be, what's not gonna happen is that students can go schedule 15 minutes of my time and then that be what it is. What we want students to do is fill out candidate sheets so we can evaluate them. That's free, free evaluation. As long as they take it seriously, then we'll get back to them and say yes or no. Now, if they don't take it seriously, don't want to do the candidate sheet, then they'll have to pay for a consultation. The consultations are like $100 or so, and that's kind of less than what they would pay an immigration attorney anyway. But if they're going to have the conversation stop, we want to make sure that there's a barrier there in compensation just so we know somebody's serious. Otherwise, this can get over flooded with requests. I think soon we might have somebody at the staff level that can maybe do that. Like one of our foreign contractors that can get on for a 15 minute consultation and say everything. But until that happens, either they need to fill out a candidate sheet. and we'll get back to them, no cost, or schedule a consultation, which is paid. When we don't do that is if a student office that we're trying to close refers us to somebody, and we do that to show the student office what we can do. Any questions? And you'll be provided with all those links and stuff like that, as soon as we get to it.",,,,,

All right. Innovative Global Talent Agency, Module 6, talking about universities and now approaching the International Student Office. The International Student Office is a very important office for universities because they make a lot of money here. Or nationals often don't get scholarships and they often have to pay full tuition, not in-state tuition to the university. So these universities are sponsored, they're approved by USCIS to issue F1 visas. And I bring this all up to say that the International Student Office can be a bit conservative about new ideas because the university has such a need to protect their ability to issue F1 visas because they fund a lot of the university, because they get a lot of tuition. Uh, without having to do scholarships. All right. So the approach to them should also be more informative than like hard sales. Like, Hey, we can help you since like, Hey, we're introducing idea. We want to have a open discussion with you. Um, and then that discussion should be like, we're looking at helping foreign nationals get job placements and stay in the country and status if they don't have a traditional employment route going. Right. And then when we talk to them, we can mention the three things. One is, hey, we have a relationship with employers where we use the O-1 visa category. We like to look at your top students and Ph.D. program, especially if they're looking at being entrepreneurs. The O-1 visa can be a huge help for them. I mentioned that we're founded by an immigration attorney that is world class, world renowned and using the O-1 visa primarily in sports and entertainment, but has also been successful in using that in more streamlined industries. Then, as the other caveat, we say, like, we have another program that is beneficial, the nonprofit, because that can get help in the door with more students. Because they might be thinking, like, yeah, our HP, you know, we don't know about our PhD students, whatever your approach. They say, like, hey, we can actually help everybody. Because the thing is, it's probably going to take a couple of getting in the door and having meetings to make them understand what's going on, then getting comfortable with that this program will not mess with their F1s. Because we're not messing with students that are currently under F1. We're looking at the ones that are transitioning out and might have issues with gaining employment. So, again, I would say it needs to be an approach like, hey, we just want to talk to you about this innovative idea that started by an immigration attorney that's worked with world champions and is now doing the same thing with talent and more traditional industries. Second is we do have solutions that are there for regular students as far as at the bachelor level. that might not have job offers and just say, we just want to have a 15 minute conversation to open up a door with stakeholders to see if you think this would be viable and get feedback from you on how it might be tweaked and potential pain points that we haven't thought about yet. Questions? And again, to gather these contacts, I will have Jonalynn go get a fresh batch for the schools and locales that we think are highly prioritized as soon as possible. So the F1 visas are just for students in general? Yeah, and that's usually done through the school, and that's why they are conservative sometimes. They want to protect that. And that F1 visa is renewed every year, or is it just for a four-year period, or just... It's duration of status. So as long as they're enrolled in school and good program, they have that. And what we do is we change them from F1 to the new work visa. Because F1 freezes out. Yeah. And they can't work on it. Then you might hear something called OPT, which is optional practical training. So you can get an extension on your F1 to file for OPT, which is like a little bit of extension, but they have to have an employer and stuff like that to do it too. So you might see like, if you hear them say OPT, that just means that's the work authorization that comes associated with their program, but it also runs out.",,,,,

To recap, typically universities will look at H-1B visas to get foreign faculty to work with them, and they usually do quite a bit of it. Some of them do their own O1s, but some of them do not. Either way, this may be a great tool for them to increase the way they can, one, have someone looking out for faculty that they'd be interested in just as a talent recruiter. And then two, as a way to get visa secure without having to pay for outside counsel to do it. So the way that we approach the universities, we say like, hey, what are your pain points when it comes to getting foreign talent to work at your school? One, is it hard finding them? Two, are you having difficulties with the H-1B process? Three, just tell us, have them tell us what are your pain points and maybe originally approach the conversation like, hey, we have this solution that's working for regular, we wanna have an informative conversation to see how this might work for you. um we tell them about the subscription basis which kind of replaces what they would pay for outside recruiting if they use it and for the cost of outside counsel if they're usually doing that for the h-1bs and again the people that we are coaching with this are usually in administration or their faculty that has background in filing visas maybe at the law school or something like that So that's the approach I think works best with the universities on the employer side. It's just to say, hey, we want to have an informative conversation with you about this potential way that we can help you increase your tool set when it comes to recruiting foreign nationals to participate in your university as employees. Questions? All right.",,,,,

It's because I'm waiting for the recording to show that it's active, which hasn't happened yet. I should have. All right. Again, we started the recording and stopped. And then if I'm talking, I'm not talking about it. I'm waiting for the recording to show. Here it is. IGTA Module 4, who are we talking to at the universities to get this across the hump? So due to this, I'm going to share a couple screens to show what we're working with now. This is some data that we pulled from iVisaJobs that talks about how many visas certain companies have filed. Tata Consultancy is one of the biggest file of visas in the nation. And they filed for 500 almost visas by themselves last year. But as we go through this list, you're gonna start seeing schools and universities. Let's see if I can find some more, especially in states where there's not a lot of people. So look, University of Michigan. Now, when we pull these universities, and I can have somebody do that and probably will, we'll see who is the immigration person involved. Because these are the people that are listed as contacts with the visa thing. So one thing we will do is have a list of schools that will have the contacts that's listed in the immigration for when they file visas. And we'll do that for every school that we can find. Right, so that's where a lot of the context will come from and look, they file for 97 H1B visas. Right, as opposed to then if you're talking about the old ones they can do, and that's even before you get to students. Right, so that's one thing we're gonna do. We're gonna have an already, I'll show you this list. So here, There's a list of the HBCUs and the International Student Office. I will go back to this. Let's go back to the statement, kind of look at who we're looking at. So the bigger schools will have. So this is a vice president. This is an immigration adviser. Maybe it's. You know, an outside counsel, then here you have faculty, staff, senior immigration adviser and FCS. But we'll get the contacts here that are listed on actual immigration forms. But we are also looking for the International Student Office because the people on the administration side might deal more with faculty while the International Student Office is dealing with the students, which is two different places in most universities, right? So that's why we need to get the contacts to both. Now I'm sharing this tab. This tab has all the HBCUs in the university, along with contacts for the athletic director, And it should have the international person. There it doesn't. Let's go down. So this list might not be as helpful. Oh, here we go. International student office. So here we have. HBCUs and we have contacts at the international office. And so what we need to do is probably fill these or you can look up to find the phone number because as you know, emails are not really like effective. But I think actually reaching out to them and just, yeah, just to do the personal thing. Whose job is to look at the phone numbers? Now we can get somebody to look up the phone numbers. Yeah. So what I will be doing is I'm going to give instructions to make a list for the my visa jobs of all the universities. Well, we can start with the HBCUs. Like, we've got to prioritize which one comes out first. Like, so we can start with HBCUs and then, like, people in Ohio, Northeast Ohio, and North Carolina that we can physically get to. I do have a question. What's the question? HBCUs, do they interfere with a lot of international people? Okay, we can skip them. Let's go back to the picture school. So I think, like... engineering school right it is so as far as which schools prioritize I'll let you have at that and also give you access to the person that does the list building so you have to wait for me to do it the person that does the list building his name is johnny and so um we can make a consolidated list that's for like the universities that you can have them look up the information and look at the phone numbers I'll all ready to go tell them So when we get off of here, I'll tell them to look up schools in Ohio, look up schools in North Carolina, and then also the top engineering schools. And then we'll start that new list with the fresh contacts for both the ones that are listed on the immigration back end, like paperwork, and then also look up their student office. And that'll be what they do for now. All right. So that is the module of who we're looking for one on the faculty side we're looking at the people that are actually listed on immigration paperwork they file out and on the student side we're looking for the international student office. Because there's two different purposes all right.",,,,,

So if I'm talking without getting into the program, that's why. OK, we're live. So we're in module. 10 I think this is going to be which is talking about build fellowship which is a non-profit that specializes in helping students and professionals stay in h-1b status when there's not another opportunity there so let's talk about it the problem is for for-profit h-1bs have a cap that they're subject to and it's like 85 000 visas every year there are 500 000 applications so just by that you're looking at a 400 000 persons that have actually got applied for that are not going to get their h-1b that doesn't include students that are graduating and don't get job offers So that's where this comes in. So if an employer files for an H-1B and they don't get them, sometimes the employers will pay build fellowship to keep somebody parked until the next time the cat comes up to file a visa. other part where we come in is at the university level we tell the international student office hey you have students that aren't getting into jobs and they want to stay in the united states then we can take them to this non-profit that has it all worked out that the student can open an llc funded with four thousand dollars and basically pay build fellowship from their llc to participate in their program which allows them to stay in the united states under h-1b why they don't have an employer place and that's what we come in is we can shop this talent to employers to get them placed The drawback is that they're not an 01, so the employer would have to still file an H1B for them, but it keeps them parked there. But that's how the nonprofit comes in. The nonprofit helps people that cannot get an H1B because they did not get one from their employer. or they don't have an employer and they're getting ready to lose their student status that comes in. And the great thing is that this has a low standard of being able to do it. You can do it at the bachelor level. You do not have to be one of the best in the world to get this program. and to us we like the the build a relationship with build fellowship because for one it does help a lot of people two is we're definitely going to get a cut on the back end by placing somebody in the programs and then three is that helps us build a relationship with the uh build fellowship to where we can use their talent pool to place them because we're bringing them revenue and they're not as worried as about us bringing out of revenue because if we take somebody out the program they're not going to be paying them that four thousand dollars a month if they get placed all right questions so the student pays that don't have four thousand dollars a month yes that a student would have to pay four thousand a month and they can't pay directly so that's a good question the way it usually works traditionally is there's an employer that filed a visa for them but they didn't get it so it might be wells fargo paying them four thousand a month to keep this a employee there but If there's no employer, a student can do it themselves by paying Build Fellowship through an LLC. So they open up an LLC, pay that money to the LLC, the LLC pays Build Fellowship, Build Fellowship pays us. All right, any questions there?",,,,,
Aug.23.2024,IGTA - Rollin Training - Univerities - What do the contracts look like - Module 3,Training Video,IGTA - Rollin Training - Univerities - What do the contracts look like - Module 3,IGTA - Rollin Training - Univerities - What do the contracts look like - Module 3.mp4,IGTA - Rollin Training - Univerities - What do the contracts look like - Module 3.mp3,"Okay, if I'm just sitting here still is because I'm waiting for this to go. I don't think, okay, here we go. So now we're into module three. What do the contracts look like and what's in them and what do they entail? And so we need to talk about three different ones. One, we're going to talk about the university subscribing to us. Ideally, we'd like to get $10,000 per month for the subscription, but we can do five. And it's for a year. So it's a 12 month long commitment. Now we can play with them, like say if they're hesitant, we can say like, hey, the contract's for a year, but we'll give you a promo code to where we won't actually charge until you use it. It's because the contract itself is very important to the visa process. Because if we have a contract with the university, USCIS can't call the work speculative. Because if we have a contract showing that they agreed to us filing the petition, and they're looking for us to get people in this kind of industry, They can't come and say, well, it doesn't look like that's actually not going to happen because they're paying us money. So that's what we really want is the contract allows us to get the old ones for multiple employers. Second is that was allows them to have access to our talent pool. That's the natural people that we're finding. putting into our pool of people that are getting visas. And then three, that gives them the opportunity to forward people to us. So they might have job postings out getting people that they like, or they have a type of profile that they would like to get. They can make those requests to us or send people to us to see if they fit in our program to bring them back to them. The reason why it's 12 months is because if it was shorter and could be canceled anytime, USCIS could call it speculative because the contract is month to month. They're like, well, they could just end this yesterday. This doesn't look like it's a bona fide non-speculative opportunity. So to recap, the ideal structure is $10,000 per month for a minimum of 12 months. But we can be flexible and make it five or we can even make it like here's a promo code to where you don't have to actually pay on the contract until we use it or something like that. But the contract itself is important for us to do the visa process. And that's what we use to allow them to have access to the talent and refer talent to us on the other side of things. We have two contracts we need to, well, three contracts we need to talk about on the talent side, meaning students. What does that look like? So if somebody is just selected by us for the talent pool, what that means, we sign a contract with them that we get rights to place them with employers. They will also have some activities that they're supposed to do in the meantime. Because before they get placed, they will still have to have things in their itinerary that they'll do. that will be put into the contract and depend on which industry they're in so if they're in computer science you might be like you have to work on some computer science projects if they are um if they're like nothing and we don't have anything we'll say you're now doing business development so your job is to go find other people like you and bring them to the program but it's really not about them actually doing it it's more about there being an itinerary in their contract to do into their place with employers If somebody's just placed in a talent pool, they do not owe us any money. They just owe us to do the activities while we file their visa under regular processing, which usually takes four to six months to get a response. They do have the opportunity to add premium processing. So they can pay us the amount of the government fee it takes to add premium processing, and then we'll add that into their application. They get decisions in 15 business days or less. the second way that they can contract with talent meaning students is executive placement that's when they'll pay us fifteen thousand dollars And we'll put their visa to the front of the line, file it like immediately, and then actively place them in positions. So instead of kind of waiting for something to come up, people that place the executive placement will have a recruiter actively calling and seeing what type of things that they're on to. And their visa process is put to the front because part of that filing fee goes to the filing. I mean, part of the fee they pay us goes to filing their visa. The third way is if they don't fit in our program or they're just otherwise not comfortable with it, we can work with byd you know build building your your building beyond whatever it is um and they have a contract where it's 4 000 a month uh they don't have to commit to a certain amount of months but that's just what it costs to be in that program where they'll file the h-1b with the non-profit and kind of park the person there and they would be responsible for um I think it's like 20 hours of work with them meanwhile we'll still actively look at placing them with jobs as well, but they might be at a disadvantage because they don't have an O-1. So they'd have to look for an employer that's willing to do the H-1B, unless we place them in a talent pool and get them an O-1. So to reiterate, university contracts, 12 years, 12 months, we like it at 10,000. Somebody that's in the talent pool, they don't pay us anything. but they do have to have some stuff in our itinerary that they do with us. We get paid when they get placed by the employer. The second way with talent is executive placement. They pay $15,000. That includes immediate filing under regular processing and active recruiting individual for them to find them placements. And then finally they can contract with the nonprofit, which is 4,000 a month, no minimum monthly commitment. Could you explain the rule of the nonprofit again? What's the rule?",,,,,
Aug.23.2024,IGTA - Rollin Training - Universities - What kind of visas do we do,Training Video,IGTA - Rollin Training - Universities - What kind of visas do we do,IGTA - Rollin Training - Universities - What kind of visas do we do.mp4,IGTA - Rollin Training - Universities - What kind of visas do we do.mp3,"all right welcome to what we do with universities module two and this one is about what type of visa categories do we deal with and that is a great question so In general, speaking of what we deal with and what we don't deal with, there's only two categories of visas that we are talking about. One is the H-1B visa. H-1B visa is the most common work visa in the United States, and that's usually what employers are looking to do for like Accenture when they get all of the tech people. That's the main one that universities use to get faculty. And there's nothing really special about it, but there's a lot of limitations. 1 is, you can only work with that particular employer for new ones. There's a capture how many of them can be given out. And then a lot of times they don't have the flexibility, or it's not the right time of year to apply for those. And it's common that employers, there's just not enough visas out there to get them. The, because there's a cap. Sometimes there's a time of the year. You can't file for new H1Bs all year round. There's a certain time of year where you can apply for them if they've never had one before. The third limitation is for the person that's under H1B themselves, they might be uncomfortable with only having that with that employer. Like they can't go start their own business with it, and they can't go immediately work for another employer with an H1B. And they can't work for multiple employers with just one H-1B. So that's the thing that we're usually trying to solve is how to get foreign nationals without an H-1B being involved. And that's where we do is O-1A visas. O-1As are for extraordinary ability for nationals. But it usually means that they've risen to the top of their field. There's a couple of advantages that come with this. One is there's no cap on these visas, so we don't have to worry about how many have been issued. There's also a lot of work flexibility that you can work with multiple employers on that same O-1 visa and start your own business without having to change them. And the O-1 visas also come with the ability to get O-3 visas for family members. So if you have children under 21 and spouses, they can get O-3 visas for the three years that you can get the O-1. The other thing that's great about an O-1 is that it's a great segue into an EB-1A green card. It's a green card where you don't need an employer at all. You can self-sponsor yourself. And the way that you get one is similar arguments to the O-1. The reason why a lot of employers don't do 01s is because they are very nuanced and hard to make those arguments to show that someone's one of the top in the world at their field. And they tend to be much more expensive to do than 01A on legal fees. Yeah, 01s usually cost maybe like three times as more on legal fees as H-1B. And that's for that reason that we're pretty selective about who we put in this program because it costs us two time and money to file the applications to do O1. So we want to make sure that we think there are great candidates for it. Now, I did mention on the student side that we do have an opportunity to work with H1Bs, but it's with a partner, another business. So there's no cap and no limitation on the time of year that certain nonprofits can file for H1Bs. So one of the things we can do is reverse a student to that business so that they can kind of be parked here and not have to leave if they have no other alternatives. So that's why I brought that up. So we do, if they do not fit into O1, we can refer them, students, graduating students to our partner nonprofit that can hold them there. And it costs like $4,000 a month. They give them like 15 hours of work stuff to do, and they pay them from that 4,000 and figure things out. But that's just what it costs. You have a question? No.",,,,,

And we will get the identified talent for the universities and process part of that process is that which is a minor part or major part of how you look at it is the visa for them and also put them in a talent pool for additional faculty positions. all right so what we're doing for universities is twofold one is universities apply for a lot of visas for their own faculty sometimes they get it sometimes they don't what we can do on the faculty side of things is have a university subscribe with us for a fee that we can be looking for people that can be employed at the university and the faculty level that's one thing we do So the university would subscribe to us, pay us a monthly fee for that. We would then help them with international talent to work there when they can't do it themselves under H-1B visas. The second thing we do is for their foreign national students that are usually at the master's level and above, they can work with us to get placed in jobs. And there's two ways they can do that. One is if we choose them for our talent pool, which means that we're going to them and say like, hey, we think you're great and we can place you. They will not pay any money to us. They will get put in our talent pool. And as we have resources, we'll apply for a visa and actively shop them to our employer partners. The other thing they have the opportunity to do is get in our executive placement program. That's when they will pay us a fee, which we will then file a visa right away and then actively place them in opportunities instead of wait for something to kind of come up. So it brings them to the front of the line and their visa gets shot for. The other program that we have for students is that, and this can be done at the bachelor's level too, is we have a partnership with a company called Building Beyond, which can place them in an H-1B program holding place while they wait for another thing. So if somebody doesn't fit in our program, as far as like being good for O-1, we do have a partnership with another business to where they would basically pay $4,000 a month and they would get them an H-1B with their nonprofit and kind of stay there. All right, to reiterate, for universities, one side is faculty. They can subscribe to us to be part of our employer that we work with and we can find and then help them get foreign nationals to work on the faculty level second is what we can do for talent one is we can choose talent to be in our pool to which they will not have to pay any money we will go and shop them out and get visas for them as we have the resources and opportunities available second is they can participate in our executive placement program where they'll pay fifteen thousand dollars that includes jumping to the front of the line when it comes to applying for a regular processing visa and front of the line when it comes to actively placing them in jobs the third option is if they are a graduate at the bachelor degree level they can be work with our partner beyond building beyond I believe it is to they can pay four thousand dollars a month and be placed into an h1b holding program that's a non-profit h1b program that they can just kind of stay in until they find another uh employer uh to work with and that that option also comes with placement so while they're in that program we can still be actively trying to place them doing that I do have a question about maybe I should be able to have a working knowledge of the type of visas we're talking about and what are the advantages of those particular",,,,,

Aug.22.2024,IGTA meng-chi,IGTA,IGTA meng-chi,IGTA meng-chi.mp4,IGTA meng-chi.mp3,"friend that's a pharmacist and I think he actually used to live in China, but I know he's been to Taiwan too. He's starting a distribution business on the wholesale side of doing farm sales. So there are some connections there. Have you been to the United States? Yeah, I've been to the United States for several times. Also for business purpose as well. OK, well, I'll start off by kind of telling you the background of our agency and kind of how we got here. So we're founded by immigration attorneys such as myself. I'm an immigration attorney by profession, and we primarily dealt only with sports and entertainment, to which we did a lot with one visas. And then the way that we do the O-1 visas in sports is we do it in a manner to where we get the visa first and the employers usually don't have anything to do with the visa. So like if we get a visa for an actor, you know, he might be available for several movies and we get one visa and he's able to do multiple movies. Or if we do it for a world champion boxer, usually the manager has the visa and then they go and compete in different promotions. And so that's the same thing that we're looking to do in the technical field. And so that's what's different about us is like we look for the best talent in the world and in industries that are good for us and then good for our employer partners. And they do a subscription base with us, which allows us to make those relationships to where they don't have to deal with the visa, like apply for H1Bs and stuff after the visa, you know, after they decide. to go with the person. They're just, they paid a subscription. We take care of the visa process. And because of that contract, that's what allows us to place these foreign nationals with, um, with the, uh, employers. Well, I didn't play bloody, but can't just like keep it down. Kind of like, uh, you are matching, uh, uh, the equator and the, uh, the right. Right. So, so, um, you know, uh, I was taking a job in the U.S. previously, and I found out that, you know, the visa requirement is kind of like a difficulty for international talent to apply for a job in the U.S. And that's, you know, most of the time you kind of like, you know, you need to have the visa first. So what would you do? Do you think like you talk to the employer first? so that they know you have the OIP that's coming and then you Right. So it's a little bit different. So our pitch to employers is contract with us because you know that we'll always keep a steady pipeline of world class talent ready to go. So it's not like we're going and looking at job descriptions. What we're doing is saying we're giving you an alternative way to just make sure you always have a pathway to talent. um because there's three ways that it might come to this companies that don't want to deal with the visa process at all which is like great for us and they're like okay you know pay the subscription there's uh companies that do deal with visas but there's a lot of times they don't get the visa for example h1bs um only 18 of those new ones get approved so we can say hey show us all the candidates that you wanted for jobs um that didn't get the visa we can maybe bring them through our program and bring them back to you The third way it comes up is if people are just recruiting for jobs and they find people they like, but it's just not during the season where they can apply, they can give those foreign nationals to us too. And that's on top of us going around the world. So say if you happen to have a big network of people that like yourself would like to work in the United States, but just don't have any job placement, then they can come into our program, which is under what we call the executive placement, where they pay a fee that includes their regular processing for an O-1, then it also places them in the front of the line when it comes to us actively pursuing job employment for them. So even for you, if you come on board, one thing that we can do to sweeten the pot is we can do, I look at your background and I'm confident that you're a pretty good candidate for 01 right so even under us we can get you a 01 to where you can come look at and that can be part of our partnership and working together okay yeah that's good yeah they've been you know like uh uh the first time and then I can really understand the process Right, but here's the thing. So one of the things about 01s is that you do have to have an itinerary of like things that you will do. And that's one of the things that we kind of like put together for our clients. So even before you get placed on an employment contract, there needs to be things in your itinerary that you do to show USCIS what you do bridging that gap. So doing the business development for us, could be what I envision, like what we use as that bridge to the gap. So like while you're going during your process, we'll put it in your visa itinerary that he's doing business development for an innovative global talent agency on a commission basis. And so that strings that time together while the process is going. So for us, So the way it works in executive placement is it does include the regular processing filing. Let's say if a person wants to speed it up, they have the option of paying for the premium processing, which gets the 15 business day decisions. Sometimes if there's a candidate that we like and we have the resources available, we'll cover those. But a lot of times we're doing regular processing, which shall take four months. Does that make sense? But we get the option that anytime a candidate wants to do the premium processing, they can just add it. It just costs more government fees, which of course, like they'll give us the government fees and we'll go ahead and apply that, right? So like even for you, like we would cover your regular processing and stuff like that. But if you want to do premium processing, because right now we're a little low because we just sent a whole bunch of visas out. But that's the option that we have. Okay, okay. Yeah. But in the meantime, we could still do it. Like, you know, you could still run your business and then, you know, say like on your first closing, we can agree to like, we'll apply premium processing, you know, to your first closing. And, you know, that could be our deal to speed things up. But the business development part would be important part of the itinerary. So we could show USCIS you are actively working on something for us even before you get the employment partnership here in the U.S. Okay, so what would be my first test? I mean, to find someone that has the intention to find a job in the U.S.? Yeah, so, right. What would be the first test? Yeah. Yeah, I would think that'd be like the first step, I think. Well, one, like we would sign you up and then we'd give you a different type of candidate sheet so we could start on your 01 because I know that you didn't work in here yourself. And we would place you in our talent pool in addition to the business development here. Then I think because of your unique position of having so many contacts in the pharma tech industry, that are overseas, I think that probably be the quickest way to bring in revenue would be other people in your same predicament. And then from there, once we get a couple of those, we can start doing the training on the employer side. Because so say, for example, if your Rolodex is the tech here, if we already have 10 people, 15 people in the pipeline, it's easier for us to get that meeting with the employer saying like, hey, We're not just saying we are getting ready to do this. We already have people in the pipeline that are ready to work and highly, highly accomplished in these fields. So that's why I think it probably be best to do the executive placements and then fill that out with some candidates. And then maybe in a month or two, then we'll go and have the the subscriptions to the employers here. So on the business end, how it works. is the program and this is not for you like so for yours it'd be you don't have to pay executive placement to have it because you know you're part of the team um but traditionally it's 15 000 to be in the executive placement that includes the filing fees 2 000 of that is the commission for you and then um the rest of it is what we use to do the visa application for the These persons would also have the opportunity to add premium processing if they wish to, which we wouldn't charge any more than what the actual government fees are for that. And that's available too. So as what you would get from the tools with us is we would get you set up with a profile with us. As far as having the email access to like our phone number, we would get you some scripts. I'm getting ready to make a training kind of like course on how to do that for executive placement that should be done. probably in the next two days. So you have an idea. And then there'll be probably weekly and biweekly updates. So even if you have a time zone insurance problem, like, you know, it's hard for you to get on the calls, we always record them. And then you have the opportunity to send in questions. So that way we don't have to, you know, interrupt the way that your normal life flow is because I know you're in a different time zone. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. And then we'll also probably place some jobs in like maybe like the Taiwan area that mentioned like, hey, you know, we have these opportunities for you to come to the United States just so you can get more candidates in and give you access to that Indeed portal so that you can see the people that are coming in. And then Once candidates are interested, what we have them do is we have them ideally fill out a candidate sheet. That puts in and do it well, so that we can tell if they're okay for the visa because we don't want to take anybody's money that we don't think is a good candidate to be successful for the visa. From there, if we like them, we'll go ahead and say, like, hey, you're a great candidate and that's when we can present them with the option to sign the contract and pay the invoice. If it's something where they want to do a consultation to be more familiar, we do have reduced fee consultations that they can do with an attorney on that side that are because usually consultations are 400. But I think under the program, they're just 100 to do like a follow up consultation to go over everything. but we like to them to fill out the link for the candidate sheet just so we can make sure that they we think they're eligible in the first place because we want to only do visas for people we know are highly likely to get it. Okay. Okay. Got it. So how long have you been doing this? This work? I mean, making the decoder and so we've been doing that the entire time as a law firm for the past six years but we just didn't separate the talent agency from the law firm right so we'd always have clients that said we'd like for you to serve as petitioner and we've done that at the highest level it's now just recently where we've decided to split those up really tried to build the talent agency to be bigger than the law firm but yeah we've been doing this model for six years yeah I think this is a very interesting model you know you can help someone like me you know to to find a job in the u.s yeah yeah yeah so what other questions do you have for me yeah so for uh you know for the old one visa uh for someone like me uh you know my background major is you know have some on my background, but also have done business side. So when I apply for O-1 visa, what would be the requirement? All right. What kind of things should I prepare for them? Yeah. Okay. So one, I'm pulling back up. So like when it comes to investments, a lot of times in business people, we base it off the success of the projects that you have worked on. So not necessarily like your own awards, but maybe like the biggest deals that you have worked on, the success of some of the startups that you have evaluated and orchestrated the investments for. If there are like some premier business people that you've worked for, like, so say if like the chairman of Xingqin is a person that has like a lot of awards himself and stuff like that, we can use that as well. And then if you happen to be paid in your role more than other people in your locale, like so say if you happen to have a higher salary in any of your positions than other people in Taiwan, we can use that as well. But most of all, we'll be basing it off of the success of the portfolios that you have worked on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we're up to it now. Gotcha. Okay. So what I was explaining is we'll be basing a lot of the 01 arguments on the success of portfolios that you have participated in. And then also on any great business people that you have worked with directly, like maybe like the chairman of like where you've at. I mean, if you can, or like other ones, because it might be the case, you might not want to let them know. Either way, we can work around it. but basically we're going to be saying that you are a premier, um, pharma tech Southeast Asian expert. So we'll make your title very, very distinct. So we can clearly show that you're one of the best in the world when it comes to that. And right now there's, AI tech, both of them, to the United States. So once we have that job title there put right, it's probably going to get preferential treatment. And then from there, what would be helpful is just like if you help us in the candidate sheet to highlight a lot of the businesses that have done well in portfolios you've worked with, highlight the best business people that you've worked with, If any of those companies have won awards, let us know that as well. If you've been paid for a particular contract more than typical of somebody in your role, let us know that as well. And that should be what it takes to get you over the hump with the O-1. OK. OK. Wow. There are a lot of details. But it sounds like it's workable. Yeah, because we do this. Yeah, because because it's all we do is 018. We just know a lot of the unique nuances it takes to be able to get those over the hump, you know. And so, yeah, the filing. on the regular processing would be covered as part of your engagement with us. And of course, we wouldn't, you know, we'd waive, we wouldn't charge you for the executive placement thing. So that part would be free and part of your contract. If you did want to add premium processing, you can do that. Premium processing is 2805 right now. 2805. Um, but you know, if you're not in a hurry, regular processing takes like three to three to four months, but you know, on your first closing, we can commit to, um, using those proceeds for your premium processing. So if you close something, then we'll add that to your premium processing as part of your, your package. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. Yeah. Sounds great. Yeah. No problem. So did you have any other questions? uh no that's not fun now yeah all right so I'll do next is I'll send you a follow-up email with um some of the you know the things we discussed um looked it over yeah um once you approve it um there is uh there's a contract for just the business development and then I'll make another one that says like for your for your o1 well you have an email you can just use the email to say like yes as part of it we'll file the uh 01a for you and then you can let us know and we'll follow the 01a and then when you do your first closing we'll apply that to your premium processing um then we can go from there okay that's good all right all right thank you thank you yeah yeah it's a very nice helping to you likewise I look I look forward to working together yeah yeah I look forward to working together too yeah all right do you have a good one Yeah, have a nice day. Bye bye. Yeah. All right, Liam. Did you hear that? Yeah. So you see now what I was talking to him about that executive placement is the same thing that we can do for a graduating PhD student. Right. The same like, hey, you can pay. Well, one is you can enter the talent pool if we like select you. But, you know, one thing is you got to kind of wait for us to have the money to, you know, when we have the resources, we'll file the visa and then we'll place you like as something comes up. But if you pay the executive placement, that means we'll do the visa right away and then actively put you to the front of line of pitching people. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of. I mean, it's more nuanced conversation than",,,,,

It's fine. So I'm waiting for it to say record, and then I'm going to start teaching to do what I do. Maybe you might have to ask some questions. I mean, this one, it doesn't matter if you talk while we're recording. So it's recording now. Franz, this is me with Liam, and we're going to show you how I do the blog post because I'd like for you to do these as well. So what happened, as you know, is I go and record videos of the video evaluations, and I like to use that text to make blog posts. So what I do is I open ChatGPT, which you have here, and I go to Video Texts. And so if I was in StreamYard, I'd do a fresh one. So if I was in, I'm going to do this tab. So this is how I get the text. I go to StreamYard. I go to Pass. download put it to text then you download it and wait a minute and so what will happen is that you'll get the text back so then and maybe watch the video watch the video a little bit to see what it's about and then um let me go from there I'm not even sure what's the first one I just made this is a o1b versus l1a oh no this was for the um stunt performer so this one okay we could just do it fresh so I'm gonna go to the text one did you get bored already look I'm about to do it now I'm about to actually do it so I go video to text now what I do is I upload I upload me talking about whatever I was talking about so here's o1 versus uh l1a it's actually supposed to be um o1 versus um l1 Okay. Use this text to make a blog post that will outrank other topics that are similar on the web. Make this for innovative immigration law. So I'll usually put IIL or SSV so you know which one it's about. It uses the style and writing of the text attached in the knowledge base. Make sure it does not plagiarize anything. Make sure it does not mention any clients by name. Write it out full length, blog post, and give metadata. Now write it. OK, so you do that. Now watch. You press go. It's going to look at the text. Look, it's writing a whole block post. Look at it. You're missing it. What happened? Who's doing that? That's the AI. Who made the AI? Who did that? Who made the AI? Who did it? No, it's using my voice of the recording that I just made to make this instructions. Are you teaching the AI or are you? So I'm using this to teach Franz how to do it. You're using the AI to teach Franz how to do it? Yep. AI also teaches you. That's right. This petal is so strong, its motor can just walk up this hill. Look. Look at this. Wait, do I even have it on here? Okay. Ooh, powerful. That's nothing. It just went up a whole hill. All right, so now I post this for you to post on IIL. I can get rid of the conclusion, and I don't like when it says unlocking. So this is post IIL. Now let's go to the next one. How did this work here? They could stop that. They all needed to turn to text. So let's go to the next one. Next one we have is Maria. So hopefully I still have that. Oh, crap. So what we can do is copy this. Put it here. But we're going to say make this one for shared sports visas. So I kind of copied and pasted that, and now it's making one for the next one. And I'll look at it. Give more context. So watch the video. So it's about. Use text. Give out the name. So this one, it didn't mention enough about the person. I mean what they did. So I'm gonna have them rewrite it. All right, so I like how they're starting this, but I'm going to say 01A versus 01B in the title. Liam, you got bored already? Yeah. But this is tight. It's doing it again. I'm talking to the AI. Look. See, it's writing. It's not writing. That's you. That's not me writing. That's me. Where's the metadata? I see you scrolling up and scrolling down. That's you. No, but it's writing. So that's SV posts. I don't want to see that again. All right. Get rid of the conclusion part. Then we can stop this like, so say, give me metadata. And if you stop it while it's doing that, it'll stop what it's doing. And now it's just pause and just give you the metadata. So here's the metadata. This is how the internet finds it. You're not into that? Oh, you did that. You're a crazy, crazy man. All right, so what do we have next? So let's upload the next one, which is tennis coach. So I'll take it's original. And I'll also take the instructions, give more context. And talk about the. Title of the beneficiary. get rid of this because that's not in there. All right, so they're getting it going. No. um um As fast as I can. All right, oh, sorry, Franz, I forgot you were there. All right, so title navigating the OA process for elite tennis coaches. Yeah, I like this one, this one's fine. Let's get rid of the conclusion. So I get rid of the conclusion, and I look for unlocking evidence. So post SSV blog. And standalone. OK. I wonder how he's doing that. OK. So now let's go to the next one. Just for the actor, we might be done here. So I'm gonna take the instructions. Okay, so let's switch this for, because it's not sports, it'll be innovative immigration law. Then give more context of actor that is a stunt person and also former athlete, 401A, 401B. You can get rid of this because that wasn't applicable. Make sure you actually watch the video first so you kind of know what it's about so you can see if the text reflects what it's saying. Go ahead and run it. I like the title. I like that it went to a case study. What are you doing on time? Okay, we got to go. Well, I'll give you the email. Huh? All right. How long do you think it'll take them? What did they say? Hopefully they'll have the parts. Huh? Hopefully they'll have the parts. Well, I also got to go say... No. Yes, I'm alone, I think. So if I could get back today, then. I just it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes. OK, so I got to go anyway. All right. Then I will post it here for sharing. Remember, get rid of this conclusion stuff. I look through it, make sure that the titles make sense, make these H1, H2, H3. So this is an SSV. No, no, no. This is an ILL post. All right, then I'll send this to you. Share this to Abb and Fred. Send it to you, Franz. Video training and post. So here are the posts, right? Now watch this. I want to stop the recording.",,,,,
Aug.22.2024,IIL - O-1 versus EB-1A visa - Samuel Etroo,Client Correspondence,IIL - O-1 versus EB-1A visa - Samuel Etroo,IIL - O-1 versus EB-1A visa - Samuel Etroo.mp4,IIL - O-1 versus EB-1A visa - Samuel Etroo.mp3,"Hello, this is attorney Sherrod Seward. I'm here doing a video evaluation for a well-established business person out of the African diaspora. And what I'm looking at is discussing the L1A versus the O1A. The L1A is the intra-company transfer visa. We have successfully done this for foreign nationals from West Africa before. One thing to know that's different is it does require a lot of corporate documentation in addition to the immigration options. you do have to file an LLC in the United States. And on the first time, one is they're going to look at source of funds too. So it's going to be pretty intrusive to looking into the business affairs of the companies. There's going to have to be a business plan to increase the number of employees in the United States. And there's only one year of eligibility that comes from that first L1 if your entity in the United States has not already been established. for a year. So you would get one year on the L1, and then you would have to apply to extend it to get the three years after that. One thing that we do specialize in is doing O1As for entrepreneurs, and we have been successful with this in West Africa too. Matter of fact, we had a person that was Nigerian attorney that owned a NASCAR team here. And that's one other problem too, is that if you're a serial entrepreneur, the L1A is specific to one business. It's not for multiple businesses. And it seems that your business has multiple fields that you get into here, which is very impressive. And another reason why I think there might be an avenue to do it under the O1A Under the 01A, you're going to go ahead and get three years. It's an excellent transition to permanent residence under EV1A if you want a self-sponsored visa. It's not intensive on source of funds. So it's not as intrusive when it comes to looking at your documents, tax, things like that. And it's dual intent. So even if you go to the embassy and you say, hey, I plan on fully coming to the United States full time, they cannot deny you. under the O1A visa. Now, if you're looking to get team members to come in too, then maybe the L1 makes sense because you can do some of the workers under you under the L2 visas that might not be available under the O1A. But I think both options for you are viable, but I just wanted to make sure that you knew the difference between them and be already made aware of how I guess somewhat intrusive, the L-1A can be over the O-1A and also to set expectations with what that first approval will be like. That first approval will be for one year, unless you've already had an LLC established in the United States for a year that's profitable and working. And then from there, you can go to extend it for multiple times. And you will have to do a business plan, corporate documents showing co-ownership, source of funds, and some other kind of nuanced things when it comes to the L1A. Under the L1A, you would have to show extraordinary ability in your fields. You would do it as a world-class West African businessman and use the accolades and success of each of your subsidiaries to try to make that argument. But I'll leave it to you to decide which one's best for you, your family, and your support staff. But either way, we look forward to supporting you. Thank you very much.",,x,x,,

Hello, my name is Attorney Sherrod Seward, and I'm doing a visa evaluation for a figure skater that is also very accomplished with doing acting and influencing. This is always interesting because we've got to choose between doing the 01A or the 01B. In this case, I think that the 01A ultimately will be the one that we go with, but also could do the 01B. And sometimes we give USCIS the option of like choosing which one fits the category. And the difference doesn't make much when it comes to anything about how long the visa will be applicable. It's just that there's different nuances for the eligibility criteria between the two. So sometimes it's easier to get approved under O1B if it's that you're influencing is more compelling than your athletics. But if you have strong athletics, then it's the O1A that will carry the day. And then we would also include those activities that you can do the O1B kind of influencing, especially if you're not already competing anymore. So in this case, we started looking at the Wikipedia, although we do not use this as a credible source. The thing is that there's a lot of good external links here that we can use here. So you see that you're a pair skater. And you represented in the Winter Olympics. So here automatically, you're looking pretty good under 01A. And I think what we would do is do it as a 01A tennis influencer. OK, because we see that you have the Olympics, that's good enough. Then these are pretty much the best theatrical ice programs that you can do pretty much in the world. You got Disney and magic on ice. Okay. So you live in London. I saw that maybe you live in Dubai now and you are modeling. Okay. Fast and furious. Very good. Oh, you're in. Yeah. So I definitely say it would be a 01. 01A we're looking at right now as a influencer influencer. know we call it a competitive uh icing influencer ice skating influencer let's look at your imdb to see what type of placements that we have here credits right so like the credits here aren't as strong as what your athletics are showing and then we see you have a pretty good following on instagram But of all of this, I would say that the Olympic skating national team and the appearances that you did with the theatrical skating carry the day and they carry the day under 01A as a world-class skater. We want a world-class ice skating professional. We'll use that so we can show both the athletics that you did in the competitive side the theatrical side and also use these placements to benefit too. But I am pleased to confirm that you're a great candidate for 01A. The one thing to think about is if you have a petitioner, that's someone here in the United States that can serve as the sign off on your paperwork. If you don't or if you prefer to have somebody independent, we do have an organization that can do that for you for a small additional fee to serve as petitioner for the three years. And pretty much just stay out of your affairs so you're free to do the many things that you're great at. So yes, we'd like to confirm you for O1A and the team will forward more information to you to get you started up. Thank you very much.",,x,x,,
Aug.22.2024,SSV  Evaluation - Pino He - Tennis Coach,Client Correspondence,SSV  Evaluation - Pino He - Tennis Coach,SSV  Evaluation - Pino He - Tennis Coach.mp4,SSV  Evaluation - Pino He - Tennis Coach.mp3,"Hello. Sorry about the loud engine outside. It seems like it just got pretty loud as soon as I started recording this. But my name is Sherrod Seward. I'm an immigration attorney with Innovative Immigration Law, Sherrod Sports Visas, and I'm doing an evaluation of a tennis coach. So when we do tennis coaches, we like to look at both the athletic accolades and most importantly, the impact that the athlete has had on other people. Of course, as a coach, there's a couple of things that are very, very helpful towards getting it over the line. The one is we do like to see success here in the United States. We can see that you are a volunteer assistant coach. It's not, you know, it'd be great. direct coach but we know without work authorization you can't be on there so we can use letters from some of the other coaches to say that's the case and we like that you went undefeated at home um the other thing is we like to look at individual players that may have very very high um results and awards, and that can tie that results directly to you. So we see that there's a freshman here that I imagine might even have a lot of junior national team experience before they came to the Ivy League. And we can see that they are the Ivy League's sole representative in the singles tournament. So we can show that your working with them, especially since it's here right on the website, was very, very important and that we can use that as comparable evidence. And we can see that you got first team all Ivy recognition. But here, is where you will really shine, especially if we can get some letters from the Olympians and WTA professionals that show that you as a hitting partner were phenomenal. So we might even say that you're a world-class tennis sparring partner as to a coach, because when we do this, the hitting partner, we can use the accolades of these professionals and Olympians as comparable evidence and memberships with you being part of the Chinese national team to the players that came to the U.S. Open. What we would need is letters from experts that we can kind of tie you into that, kind of show the impact that you had. Even if it turns out not to be that much, we can always use it to tell the story as much as we can. But between you being with the Ivy League first team recognition people and with the WTA and Olympians, And along with accompanying the Chinese national team, you're an excellent candidate for 01A as a coach. And we would do it as a tennis professional, or we might even do it as a world-class hitting partner, depending on what the rest of the evidence looks like once we start your process. But I'm going to give the team the okay to highlight you as an excellent candidate and forward you to the next steps. Thank you very much.",,x,x,,
Aug.22.2024,ILL - Evaluation Poorva Wachh - Actor,Immigration Non-Sports,ILL - Evaluation Poorva Wachh - Actor,ILL - Evaluation Poorva Wachh - Actor.mp4,ILL - Evaluation Poorva Wachh - Actor.mp3,"hello this is attorney sherrod seward doing a evaluation for o1b visa we have a great actor stunt person that is inquiring and we're just going to show how we look through this um first we'd like to see his placements of course that there is previous things we see that there is the saga and a tennis player we can actually use two we can use those athletic achievements to show um how those have translated into a more physical style of doing acting. Nice that they have a profile. Very nice. And it's varied. So sword fighting, board breaking, along with the tennis. It's great that we bring that all in because all these we can use to help build the file up. The next thing we like to see is the IMDB for actors to kind of see if there's been any nominations and awards. So look, we have here 11 wins, 9 nominations. That's great. Okay, so we have acting credits, producing credits, and writing credits. This is perfect. So what we'd like to see even more is when we get the actual candidate evaluation for the, I guess, kind of how commercially successful that these were. Being that they're a specialized person, they're a stunt person, that's not going to be as important as how individually well these movies did. But this is great, and I think it's a great candidate for 01. The thing we would need to know is if there is a petitioner already involved. If there's not, we do have a sister organization that can serve as the petitioner agency for an additional cost. But this is a great case for EB1A, and we look forward to working with this person. Thank you very much.",,,,,

How's it going? This is Sherrod Seward. Can you hear me okay? Yeah. First of all, I want to say apologies for this morning. Meetings mixed up. Yeah. Your phone is kind of quiet. I know you can hear me, but I'm having a little problems hearing you. Is there any way you can make the volume louder? If not, it's no problem. Can you hear me? Yes, that's much better. That's much better. Yep. Well, one, I'm pleased that you have an interest in working with us. I looked at your background and I think there's definitely a skill set we could take advantage of, but I'd like to learn more about you, your interest in the role and kind of what you think your skill sets are. Yeah. Okay. So do I need to share? Yes. Okay, so I have worked for the reporting side for more than 4 years. I am very stable in my internal accounting service as well, both tech and accounting. So you can see better details in my resume about my job separation placement. So most of the time, let's say for the current position Awesome. And where are you located? Are you located in Vietnam or where are you located? Yeah, I'm located in Vietnam. So I just want Yeah, so our role is very flexible, and it kind of be, you know, you don't even have to quit your current role to kind of do it just the way that ours is modeled off of. So have you ever placed anybody or come across people that would like to work in the United States? From the United States? No. Actually, I have a question on changing how to place in the United States. okay that's awesome that's awesome and and you said and your most of your rolodex is in tech related um um placements lately correct um Got you. That makes sense. That makes sense. Well, just kind of tell you about us. What we do that's different is our business is started from immigration lawyers. That's what we primarily are, immigration lawyers that help people come to the United States and get work visas. What happened was a lot of these people, the jobs they wanted did not want to serve as sponsor for their visas. So we started a talent agency that served as the sponsor for their visas. So now what we're doing is we're looking for somebody to help us reach out to people and that have the skill sets of what our employers want. in the United States and if they have the want to work here, what we do is we get them a visa and then we actively work on placement. What we'd like for you and your role is we understand that you probably come in contact with a lot of people that are not American but would like the opportunity to come work here with the work authorization. so we're looking for introductions to those people to come into what we call our executive placement program to where they pay fifteen thousand dollars two thousand of that would go to you as a business development consultant and what they get with that is that they get us to file a visa on their behalf and then we actively look for job placements for them um we have We have certain type of profiles of people that we're looking for. Usually it's engineers, tech persons, healthcare, and then people that are like high level in the automotive supply chain, which I see that you know a lot about. right and so we figure as you get candidates and you're seeing different people apply for jobs you can just bring it up say like hey have you ever thought about moving your family to united states and working and if they say yes um you can have them fill out a candidate sheet because we don't do this for everybody we have to make sure that they are good candidates for the visa then we'll say like hey we're comfortable with working with you and then that's where we can start to see if they want to close and pay the application fee to be included in the program does that make sense Got you. So what questions do you have about the role? Right. So in your case, since you're already overseas and you already talked to a lot of talent, we would rely on you more for the talent side. So we would work on the employer side. If it comes up, that's okay, but we're more relying on you to go find the candidates and get them to participate in the executive placement program. And Also, we know that there are a lot of people in Vietnam that do what's called the EB-5 investment visa, where they'll pay to start a business in the United States and turn to a green card. We have another Additional, they're good. I'll say it like this. They're good candidates for the executive placement too. And we do versions of that that have the green card that come with them. And it costs much less than starting a business. So if you know high level executives and people that are wealthy that may want to come to the United States to live, that is a program that we do too. right so what we will do is um we'll place some some job descriptions out like we'll probably put some in uae we'll put one in vietnam and so as those candidates come in you can kind of peruse and and um contact them to see if they're good fits. But probably by Monday, we'll have those job descriptions out in the UAE. And maybe if you let us know what markets look good that you're comfortable dealing with, we'll put those applications out. And as they come in, you can have at them. And we'll get you set up on the back end with, of course, an email address from us. You can use our Google Voice number. and I'll make some training videos that you can use for rebuttals and then I'll point you to specific points on our website and special links to where the candidates can go fill out their information and of course they'll be a manager that you could always kind of talk to to get on the nuance of the process that will be responsive to you and support you in this endeavor because I know this process is a little bit different um than traditionally but I think you'd be great enrolled So what other questions did you have? Yeah, this one is commissioned. So for executive placements, if they don't want the green card, we charge $15,000 and $2,000 of that goes to you. And then if they want, if it's somebody that's doing the green card version, then 3,500 would go to you. And they'll start it. Yeah. So would be paid on the table? So we like to use PayPal or Wise is our preferred. If that doesn't work well, we can figure it out. But PayPal and Wise are typically what we like to use. Yes. Yes. Yes. There's a follow up. We'll send you a service agreement for you to look over along with a description of kind of what you can look forward to as next steps from us. Right. No, no problem. We are really grateful to have somebody with your skill set, and especially in that region of the world with so much experience. So I think you'll do great in this, in this role. And I think we'll both make a lot of money, honestly, and do make a lot of people happy as well. All right. Say it one more time. video meeting. Yeah, we'll have another video meeting. So you'll get an email that will have the contract and next steps for your review. If you're comfortable with it, you can sign it and then we'll get a video meeting scheduled probably for later this week or early next week. All right. Well, sounds good. Thank you for your time and look forward to that email. It should come in the next couple of minutes. Yep. Sounds good. Talk to you soon. Bye.",,,,,
Aug.20.2024,IGTA - College Training,Training Video,IGTA - College Training,IGTA - College Training.mp4,IGTA - College Training.mp3,"Hello, thank you for paying attention to this talk about Innovative Global Talent Agency and how we partner with universities to offer several solutions that help with the international side when it comes to both faculty and both to graduating students. First, let's talk about faculty. We know that universities are some of the premier organizations that apply for H-1B visas, which are the traditional way that foreign nationals that have masters come and work at universities. But we also know that these visas have their limitations, especially when it comes to faculty that doesn't want to be full time and maybe when it's in between when you can file for H-1B visas. The solution that we bring is we have a subscription to where we can do O1 visas for top tier faculty members to where the university will pay us a monthly subscription fee. And for there, that will allow them to have access to our talent pool that does include professor worthy minds from all over the world in some of the hard to find industries. and they can also suggest people to us that are interested in the university or they're interested in as part of the recruitment process to bring them in where we'll handle the o1 visa and make the person available for working uh with the university and it would be pretty immediate they wouldn't have to wait for the visa as if they're applying themselves we would go ahead and take care of that for them so we have talent that they might want and they can also suggest talent to us where they don't want to deal with the h-1b process The next thing we do is we help students. We help them, students that are graduating, stay in the country with proper work authorization, especially if they don't have a job or if they want to be entrepreneurs or if they are athletes or something similar. For athletes, we can serve as petitioner, which means we sign off on their visa work, and then they're able to use the P or O-1 visa to do competitions. This is common with track. And then if they are doing something like tennis, where they might be coaching, if they are eligible, we can apply for O-1 visas on their behalf and actively try to place them with clubs and sponsorships. On the other side, for the more higher skilled graduates at the master's and especially the PhD level, we can do a couple of things. One is We have a relationship with a nonprofit that helps people that are in the H-1B category be able to stay in the country under that category by putting them in this nonprofit program where they work probably about 10 hours a week and they can self-fund themselves, which I'll get into the technical side of that. But that's one thing that we offer for the master's level and the bachelor level candidates is the opportunity to participate in the fellowship program to basically stay under H-1B status until they get picked up by an employer, which may be on their own volition or through us if we're actively trying to place them. The other thing we can do is the same thing we do with faculty, is where we'll serve as petitioner for O1 visas for people that are usually at the higher master's degree, LLM, or PhD programs. And we will serve as their sponsor and then also find a place to put jobs with our employer partners that are similar to what we do with the universities, where they will pay us a fee. and subscription, which allows us to place the O-1 visa holders with them for placement. And those are the services we can offer to the university levels. One is for faculty. The university can subscribe to us as an employer client, which allows us to do the O-1 visa as a US agent for multiple employers. Second is we can help graduating students that do not have jobs be able to get H-1Bs with a nonprofit that they can self-fund. Third is we can offer the O-1 solution for the higher tier graduates at the PhD, LLM, and STEM master's programs. Thank you very much.",,,,,
Aug.20.2024,IGTA Training with Joshua,Training Video,IGTA Training with Joshua,IGTA Training with Joshua.mp4,IGTA Training with Joshua.mp3,"recording start so that way I can make it okay okay the recording started so we do have lists well let's talk about this first um put that all right so the attorneys that we're reaching out to the ones that do 01 visas when they do visas for startup like people looking to start businesses U.S. immigration attorneys that live in other countries, like Charlie's lawyer, and then EB-5 lawyers. This one's like the least important. And we're going to be selling them three things when we call them up. We're going to say, hey, we're selling petitioner service for their clients that do not have a petitioner, as you understand what that is. We say we're doing consulting to help set up itineraries. And that's what something I also talked to about in that message for lawyers, right? Was that in the last video I sent? Not sure. I think it's not. All right. So the petitioner service, you understand, that's where we serve as the entity that signs off on the visa paperwork. Yeah. What I'm talking about. fill the client's time with activity to keep their visa rate. So like whenever you do an O or a P visa, you have to have stuff on your itinerary that shows USCIS will be actually doing something. Okay? Yeah. And then we do job placement, employment, And then we also, if they want to start their own businesses for business owners, we help them own 100%. Okay. So that's, these are the four things we're trying to sell the attorneys we do. And the call to action is just get them to schedule a conversation with. Okay. All right. And the type of clients to who are these services helpful? So this is helpful to people. These are the clients of the lawyers, ones that are H1B clients, ones that want to do startups, but they're foreign nationals, graduating students, and then people that are filing for O and P visas. Okay? Okay. Then we already have some lists that you can reach out to, and those are here. So these are the lists that we're going, but I'm going to show you something else. Sometimes I might be going to a certain city and I want to meet with people. So say I'm going to Columbus, I might say I need a business. So the type of lawyers we'll be looking for are business and employment and then investing. There's only two that we might look at. Usually it's business appointment. And then we'll say, I'm going to Columbus, Ohio. So you would look up the zip code for Columbus, Ohio and see if they have them all here. Right. So we see 4 3 0 3 5. So they can put in a zip code 4 3 0 3 5 and put it in like 20, 20 miles search. Then you can go through these, uh, Oh wow. That's all there is. Then you can go through those attorneys, call them and see about that service. You know, trying to get me the meeting. You're right. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah. So like even I'm going to Columbus on Wednesday, so I do want you to call, um, call Columbus for meetings on Thursday. Okay. So I put the hand call. Okay. All right. Then, um, I want you to take a shot at making a draft of emails to send them and then making a draft of like the call list that you do. I'll let you do it and then I'll edit it from there. But let's make this the task right now and then also sending the messages for the talent people and then keep closing the immigration business. And we'll do that for now. So like the cricket stuff, it's not as big of a thing. And then contacting people for employers for trying to get the meetings for that. And it didn't go too well. So that's fine. So we'll leave that alone for now. But that's what I want you to do. Call the attorneys. Go ahead. Did you have a question? Yeah. And for a meeting that's going to be face-to-face since you're going to go in Columbus, Ohio, correct? Correct. Correct. On Thursday. See if they can meet on Thursday and Friday. Okay. Thursday or Friday. Anytime. Yeah. And then let me know about those recruiters that you are talking to too. Give me an update tomorrow. Yeah, sure. No worries. Yeah. All right. No problem. So that's all I have for now. I appreciate what you're doing. I will work on the wise and keep doing a good job. Yeah, thank you so much. I'll wait for the voice because it's still in review status. So yeah, thank you so much for that. No problem. Talk soon. Yeah, have a great day. Peace.",,,,,

This particular training session, I'm going to be doing live calls, calling attorneys, probably leaving a lot of messages here in Charlotte for attorneys that we think do H-one B and O-one visas. And we're going to kind of introduce the petitioner service and the talent agency and try to get some traction and some meetings. So just watch for the nuanced ways that I present the information and the arguments that they are likely to find persuasive. Thank you very much.

At home, please record your message. When you finish recording, you may hang up or press the pound key for more options. Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward. I'm my background and attorney that focuses a lot on O-one visas and sports and entertainment. But I'm calling you about my new venture where I am a talent agency and we work a lot with immigration attorneys with our petitioner service. When there's no other petitions or even when there are, and it presents an advantage to deal with us, for example, H-B hopefuls that maybe don't get the cap or they are in H-B, but want to do the job and also start their own business, maybe for. um students that are graduating and unfortunately don't get a job and then also for athletes entertainers professionals um that want to file for pr o one visas but do not have a petitioner uh what we do is and you know of course do the i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i and we work well with immigration attorneys and I'm here local in charlotte and would like to talk to you more about it and get your feedback to see of ways we can improve the service again my name is sherrod seward and you can reach me at this number and I'll also follow up an email thank you very much So you see there, I kind of rambled a little bit, but I did speak on some of the advantages that attorneys would be good to see. So we'll be hopefully not as rambling. One thing I did forget is the follow-up. So I'm going to look her up. Oops, looks like I can still find her. There's numerous points of contact. So I'm going to find her. I am going to connect with her. I could have sent the note, but that's fine. And then I will also send an email to her. So I want to show you the full breadth of how we're doing this. I think I have my pictures here. I'm actually going to copy this because this one has the link that's ready to go. All right. So that's one. And then I'll update the pitch to have that. Cool. All right. So let's wait for the next call. All right. Next, I'm calling Daniel Chrisman, who's a pretty well-known attorney here in Charlotte. You have reached Crispin Legal Immigration Office. We are currently closed. Please leave us a message and we will return your call as soon as possible. Hello, my name is Attorney Sherrod Seward, and I was calling for Mr. Daniel, well, Attorney Daniel. And I was calling because I was looking to see if I can talk to him about my new venture. Historically, I do a lot of P-one and O-one visas for athletes and entertainers that was pretty much all the practice that I did. Uh, but I've turned over the operations to focus on my talent agency. But one thing I'm looking to do is partner with attorneys that also do employment based immigration, um, to talk about my petition of service. Uh, we have a petition of service where we serve as petition on form island, mostly in Oh one visas. And it's very helpful for, um, Employers, ones that maybe have talent that they want to put on O-one and that talent wants more flexibility than the H-one B. Maybe graduating student clients of you that didn't get picked for the cap. Then also entertainment folks and other professionals that might be O-one worthy. What we do is we do the petitioner work, we do advising on the itinerary, and we actually do job placement as well for both professionals and entertainers. But I just wanted to reach out to you, introduce myself. I'm here local to Charlotte. Be good to hear from you and exchange ideas. Thank you very much. All right. I probably should be sharing my screen. So you can see. I'm working this out. All right. So I'm going to go to LinkedIn. Connect with him. Add a note. All right. I think we already sent him one. All right. That's my message. All right. So that's good on that one. Let's get a little listserv, just going down the list. And if you want to know this one works for shoemaker loop, when you see something like that, that usually means that they are a, uh, a large employer, larger law firm. So usually what we can do is just kind of hopefully copy all this. And it should bring up their law firm. Yep, right there. Oh, she's in Tampa. But who cares? We'll give her a call anyway. While we're doing that, we'll add her on LinkedIn. Hi, my name is Maria Ramos, and I'm with Shoemaker, Loop, and Kendrick. I'm unable to take your call at this time, but if you would please leave your name, phone number, and a brief message, I will conduct you into the call. Thanks. Record your message at the tone.

But I'm calling you for my new venture, which is a talent agency. The way it came about is we used to serve as petitioner for a lot of our clients when they didn't have another alternative. And I just kind of decided that there's a lot more I can do there. And I prefer to work with immigration attorneys and do the talent agency. Just to give you an example of when it's helpful, one is when you have maybe H-B clients that also want to have a startup business. This is great for just startup business, foreign nationals in general, so that they can own a hundred percent of their business instead of self-petitioning and having to give up control. and then we're also very helpful for graduating students and athletes and entertainers how our service works is we of course serve as the petitioner we advise on the itinerary to make sure there's plenty of things for the the candidate the beneficiary to do and then we also do job placement as well to help round that itinerary and keep the clients happy so it's not something to kind of replace the h-one b's and the work that you do with your employer clients but kind of give an alternative when there's something more flexible that's needed. But either way, I'd like to talk to you about the concept and I'll let you know. I'll follow up with email. Thank you very much. All right. So. Well, there's her. All right. Then we'll also send her an email. Right here. I'll send it for shared sports visas, but I'll send it from Global Talent for this one. Let me go to my pitch deck. I'll go follow up on call. Cool, sent it. That's not good. Well, this one is a guy I know. And I'll just send him a message. Let me make sure I didn't already send him a message. Monday, August, twelve. That looks like it was supposed to be the right number. Let's see. Seven zero four. Here we go. I'm sorry. Your file cannot be completed as follows. Please check the number. Oh, that's weird. Let's tell him not to apologize. All right. So we got that there. I'll pause. All right. This is an attorney I do not know, but let's give him a call. Looks like he might do a lot of things with students. So let's see if there is something here. I'm looking at this right here. Thank you for calling Devos HM Law Firm.

I was calling for attorney Douglas Kim. I'm located here in Charlotte and traditionally do a lot of P-one and O-one visas for sports and entertainment folks from all over the world. But I've kind of folded down the practice and that's to build my talent agency where we work with a lot of immigration attorneys that deal in employment based immigration. to serve as petitioner for clients that might not have another alternative or might need more flexibility. For example, for students that are getting ready to graduate that are good for O-ones, we can serve as petitioner, help build their itinerary, and then also provide job placement services for them. So I was just looking to introduce myself, see if I can talk about the concept with Attorney Kim and see if there's ways that we could work together. And you can reach me at this number, which is nine, six, five, six, two, two, four, nine, three, seven, two. That's nine, five, six, two, two, four, nine, three, seven, two. Thank you very much. So then of course I'm gonna try to add them on LinkedIn. That's all. I'm not. You know what, since I see him who said So they say it's available on mobile. So it could be the case you're just not messing with me. You never know why. Okay. Let's get to the next one. I'm calling an attorney I know. You've reached Charlotte Immigration Law Firm after normal business hours. Please give your name, phone number, and a message, and we will return your call the next business day. Thank you. Hello, this is Attorney Sherrod Seward calling for Mr. Well, Attorney Snyder. I was just calling because I would like to one, catch up with you, see how you're doing, then catch you up on something I'm working on. I could use your feedback. I have decided to kind of step back from doing direct practice of immigration law, instead rolling with my talent agency. I kind of started by accident as I was serving as petitioner for some of my clients and then in turn for clients of other attorneys. But it's taking a life of its own and kind of give you an example how it works is it's great for persons that are currently under H-B and maybe want to start their own business and keep the same job that they have. It's great for graduating students who can't get an H-I-B, but may be great O-I candidates. Then, of course, it's great for entertainers and athletes that do not have a petitioner. What we do is we, of course, serve as a petitioner. We provide advisement on setting up the itinerary, give them things to do. And we also do job placement where appropriate. But I'd like to just get your feedback on the concept. Maybe you can help me think about some things I did not. But either way, it'd be good to catch up with you. And you can reach me at nine, five, six, two, two, four, nine, three, seven, two. Thank you very much. So I won't send them an email, but I'll do it like this. I don't know. Cool. Now let me see if there's anybody else that I feel like calling today. We get Garfinkel. That'd be good. Actually, let me do this. Let's use a partner. Then we'll call it a day.

All right, cool. Game plan, big wigs. Think about coming up there like September 5th or so. Okay. There's a FAMU versus Miami game. I think I went to that game last year. I think you did, right? You and your dad went, no? Oh, no, it was Miami versus Miami. Miami versus Miami? What do you mean, Miami versus? No, FAMU versus Miami, but Miami versus Miami, Ohio versus Miami, Florida. Yeah. Cool beans. Well. Am I going to be able to proudly wear that Browns jacket you got for me this season? I don't have to keep it in the closet. I'll get you a t-shirt. Maybe a headband or something. It's going to be a good year to have something. All right. Cool beans. So what you got, man? Well, nobody's really picking up the phone for me that has a big old title, but it's okay. Yeah. I mean, that's, you know, You got that, you know, that that's a long-term deal. Cause it takes, you know, it takes something for them to really, you know, they gotta have like an immediate need for them to jump on that. You know, like, yeah, like someone's putting, yeah. Putting a foot up their butt on that particular issue. So then it'd be like, oh, let me see, let me deal with it. But other than that, you know, you just gotta keep fishing. Yeah, I mean, I don't take any offense to it. I just keep pushing to get in front of him. My development muscle is calloused now, so I'm making all sorts of cold calls. I'm back in the mud of things, and I don't mind it. Matter of fact, when I come down there, they would get in front of Malky. He hasn't been I don't know why. Say it again. I said, remember, I was trying to get Malky to meet with you. But maybe when I come down there, we can go to Miami and kick some doors down. Yeah, just go down and go say what's up. Right. All right. So in the document game plan for the big wigs, I went through a list. Most of this is from the 212F when they had COVID. And there's only certain organizations that had the privilege of being able to ask the White House to get people in. They release, I don't think they were supposed to, but they released like the names of all the people that could do that, which included me. I was one of the people on this list. But that's where a lot of these people come from. And that's how I know that they're probably the decision maker when it comes to diseases. I dissected them, or I mean, of categorize them by team leagues and then by individual leagues and then like um professional like contacts and professional works the reason I did that is their team leagues I've been trying to push um using like the idea of using agent-based visas to to kind of like help them out right And so I sent them an email about that. And of course they haven't hit back, but that's the reason I put them in a certain category. Cause there's that kind of avenue in there. It's like, Hey, I just want to let you know, you might be able to help your, you know, your players. If you do some patient based stuff, you might, you might not even know that you could do this. And so that might be a way in on an informative side from you coming and sending them a message. Like, you know, after I did, you know, not with me copy, cause I didn't copy you in a lot of these messages, you know, the ones that I did, the idea was like, you know, but my thing is there's opportunity to come in on just like hey you know I just acquired a law firm that did a lot in this space I did this I just want to introduce myself and kind of figure out where your pain points are right yeah so um let's see I could share this let me present and go through it No, I'm not saying there is. Hold on a second. I'm sure. Just go ahead and do what you're doing. I'm coming right back. All right.",,,,,

Aug.16.2024,Sherrod speaks on poker immigration,Immigration Sports,Sherrod speaks on poker immigration,Sherrod speaks on poker immigration.mp4,Sherrod speaks on poker immigration.mp3,"Jack Moore. Yeah, speaking. Pretty good. This is Sherrod Seward. Yes, yes, yes. Yep. Thank you for your patience and flexibility. I know we're supposed to get together early on the week, but glad to be here and answer your questions. No problem. I appreciate your patience with, you know, the length of this thing going on. And also, I guess, and I'm going to apologize because my throat is pretty raspy still. Okay, I can hear you. I completely lost my voice the other day, but it's supposed to come back, but it's still my name. Oh, no problem. No problem. I can understand you very clear. I'm proud to be succinct, so you don't have to use it so much. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So effectively, I just wanted to schedule this to get a better understanding of the strategies for the A1 visa. Because I'll just give a little bit of background in that I don't specifically need this visa right now. It would be handy to have it now. It would open up opportunities. But it's like I'm at a stage where I spend another year getting more tournament results through poker, and another year maybe doing more work, working on branding and stuff. It gives me a much higher chance of success. That would be no problem, and I'd be very happy to do that. But you seem pretty confident that you can get it for me. And so I kind of just, you know, want to understand a bit more of the details of where we're at and what the strategy would be if we were to go forward at the moment. Well, I guess in its core, what we're doing is trying to prove, well, kind of like, I guess, tell a story that you are one of the best in the world at a specific field. Since you are more diversified than just playing poker, there's a lot that we can do with it. So when we say, hey, this is a poker professional that also focuses on the engineering, computer engineering side of the thing, that's when we shrink the job title to only mean a specific individuals and so we're saying like hey there's not that many people out there that play professional poker at this level and also do computing engineering at the same level and have already applied it to poker right so that's why it's different that's like oh no this is a no-brainer for us on 01 because one is just it's going to be really easy for us to prove that there's not a lot of people out there in general that are doing that and so then we can use and then and then on the evidence side we can use the evidence of both your poker playing and your computer engineering And then combine that with how you've already applied that in, you know, in poker, you know, we can even say stuff like, Hey, the computer engineering actually helps them in his professional poker, which he uses to get contracts outside of it to do, you know, both men together. So on the, who we're comparing you to is smaller compared to the wealth of evidence we can use is much, uh, much bigger. And then the company. that hired you is ran by one of the, you know, best players it's been, Dylan. Dylan. Is it Dylan? Yeah. So this is an easy word. Okay. Interesting. I mean, I have to say, I spoke to someone else who saw it as a very complex case. And I spoke to them mostly just to get a better understanding, yeah. And they were generally under the impression that I don't have the skills as a poker player or as a, you know, and, you know, I originally, my assumption beforehand was, you know, that it's not, it's obviously not about either side of it. It's about a combination of the two. But I was curious, you know, like with UC, sorry, USCIS, you can file like, you know, specifically as one or the other, or is it a combination? Like, no problem. We do the combination all the time, but I wouldn't blame other people for not doing it. It's just that other people do a lot of things. We only do one thing. So, you know, they might've just never tried. We, we fortunately have, you know, so like your job thing, you know, we'll play with a little, it might be like poker player, poker, professional data science scientists, or like poker, you know, like we'll combine that in the title and then we'll go and Google you know, we're going indeed and put that in and see, we'll go and do like a Google search of this, like see who comes up and just like, Hey, this, this doesn't exist. And right now there's a big push from the Biden administration to get computer engineering folks in right now. So, um, that's looked favorably upon right now, especially before, you know, the administration changes later. Yeah. So that's another reason why now might be a good time before whoever the hell is here, you know, and yeah. Yeah. Um, okay. Um, and so I guess it just leads us on to, you know, effectively, um, because I know we have to, you know, explain, uh, the three areas is my general understanding. Is that, is that pretty much it? Yep. Three of the areas that, they pay and then free of enough to get in those areas. Right. Yeah. I mean, there's three, like, so there's three of the, you know, areas that we have to prove, but you also can do something called comparative evidence. So that means like, if you were a coach of coaching a Olympic athlete, then we can use that athlete's goal. In this case, you have, you've been assisting one of the best poker players in the world and his company. So we can use the success of that company and maybe even the success of him and We also have some pretty good placements winning in poker. We can throw that in there, too. We can use original contributions on both sides of that. And we can use the press of his business, you know, and, like, you know, some of the other things. There's a lot we can do. Yeah, I guess, I mean, I think there's a lot we can do. I guess, like, my question around it, like, obviously, like, even like aside from like obviously Dylan is very successful and the business is successful but most of like most of the work is under like an MBA you know it's so complex that I don't want other people to have that work and then following that I can't really like you know do contributions to the field because I'm working for specific clients that you know what a piece of software that you can have no one else can have So I was curious on your thoughts on how you like navigate that stuff. All right. So let's start from here. Would they be willing to provide you a letter if they were comforted that like it's just used for internal purposes under attorney client privilege that it won't get out. Right. And they can be as vague as they want. You know, we were working with somebody now that's MI6, which I'm sure you know what that is. And. They can't talk about a lot of the stuff that they have done. Right. But they can get it outlined without giving up without giving up the proprietary data of what they're kind of talking about. And then they can just look this up like, yes, he did this for me. It is so important that I really can't even say exactly what it is. But the results of it have allowed me to do this. right and then that's all we need because it's not about the it's not about disclosing technically what you did it's more about saying like hey whatever you did was world-class and it produced these results yeah yeah okay that's last yeah I i mean and my presumption is that can be done fine like I don't really deal with the time specifically you know because you're dealing with me So I think that would be fine. I have more doubt that we couldn't get the right person, the right letter in there. I presume that you pretty much just create the narrative and you just want to sign. Yeah, yeah. We write it up. Yeah, we write it up. And then they just sign it. And then we write it up. You look at it and make sure you're fine with it. And then either you present it to them or the team can present it to them. And then that's it. Everybody's comfortable. Mm-hmm. All right, fair enough. So, okay, so for that side, you know, we can probably do the contributions within the business, which makes sense. And so I guess we're saying for the Trophies Award, like, my stuff is okay. It's not particularly special. I guess Dylan, you have to do, you know, help his business, which in part is creating success. And so he is saying I can use his results to help out. Yeah, we'll use his results to help out. And then we'll say your particular results are as a data scientist. I'm not necessarily a full-time poker player, but as a computer science poker player applying that knowledge. And then we're looking at your Scotland all-time money list, 114th out of all-time. We can use that. We did... see some let's see that's also a poker news report I think that might be a profile but we can kind of put that in and try to you know argue that that's like kind of press thing about it to show it yeah and um yeah and then we'll argue that under remuneration that your total live earnings not for all poker players but for like data scientists dealing poker is like we can't find anything that's even remotely like this right yeah on top of using dylan's success himself so yeah this one looks pretty good looks like you've been traveling a bit and no no I'm sorry I'm looking at the um somebody else's itinerary they just have like tournaments posted to the right I'm on her hand and hand and mob and sometimes I look over like oh shoot you're going to daytona beach I'm like no that's just they have tournaments posted there I think it's been pretty good this year except it's just been just been good we've like specifically in tlo you know it'd be very very good And then, like, I, you know, I looked up, I'm like, full supply of the year in Scotland, specifically. So, like, I, yeah, I guess that was another thing, because obviously most of these results are shown within Great Britain compared to Scotland, and within Great Britain, I'm like, 50-something, which, you know, whatever, it's okay. Yeah. But within Scotland, I guess you just need to try and average as much as you feasibly can get away with. That's right. That's right. National awards can carry the day. They don't have to be international. The thing is that they have to be recognized internationally. So in those letters, we might say like, yes, he's ranked 114th all time in Scotland, but that carries weight, especially as, you know, a data scientist will have that from, you know, if this person is from the United States and this person's from Scotland, you know, we kind of use that to show that this particular accomplishment is known and respected worldwide, even though it's a national accomplishment. Yeah. Um, I, kind of like I mean the idea that I'm presenting as a data scientist that's a poker obviously within like a data scientist um my understanding is that well I mean computer scientists I'm sorry are you do you consider yourself a computer scientist or a data scientist yeah It's a full tweet of it. But my question is, my understanding is with computer scientists applying for O-1 visas, they have to get recognition from a specific group of computer scientists? No. No, you're talking about the consultation letter. We can do with that. Remember, we're not calling you a data science computer scientist. We're calling you a poker computer data scientist. You're the best in the world. see you see what you did right yeah no I mean at the end of the day like I fully understand that you don't have to be replaced by one very very high level poker player and one pretty good computer scientist um and that's pretty hard to find uh so like my specific skill set is definitely you know I do understand that it's very useful. I guess my concerns have been my ability to pre-blast while doing a lot of work under NDAs. And then, you know, almost the idea that... I just, I guess, the other person I spoke to kind of felt like it was more of a, you know, like, you can't really combine these areas. I guess there's a misunderstanding on it. um and so yeah obviously your knowledge of having done this before is very handy in that area um I i guess in that fact like how many like do these have a combination no one to be done um dozens it's something quite common yeah I mean because we do it pretty much every time somebody's an athlete that every time someone's an athlete we put an o1 we do that um because we they want to do stuff other than compete and they've already started coaching and stuff like that so if they're a boxer we're calling a world-class boxing professional if they're a driver we call them a world-class driving professional or motorsports professional so that way we can always say like oh well they've consulted on this project and they won't just be driving but they'll be doing podcasts they might open up a team shop you know All our O1s pretty much are some kind of combination because we're not just saying, hey, this is a world-class boxer. We're saying this is a world-class combat sports professional because we like to open up the... the work authorization as much as possible. And here's the other thing, I think you said that you did have a petitioner, but one thing to bring up to you is that we do, especially me, I work mostly on our talent agency side of things where we're looking at actually finding the best data scientists, computer scientists in the world, putting them on O1s and then placing them with major companies. and on major projects. Because honestly, for us, if we're placing, we get bigger fees as a talent agency than we do as a law firm. So that's what I'm interested in. I'll put that in front of you. But that's something like, so say if you were with us as a petitioner, we would put the activities that you're going to do on your own in there. But then it would open you up to where we can place you if we have something comes up that you're interested in. That's interesting. I guess my understanding was that the petitioner, you kind of worked for them in a way. And so, like, obviously Dylan, like, I mean, it makes a lot of sense for me to use Dylan. I mean, with the employment, the way we're doing things, you know, I work for him at the moment. But, you know, I guess it would confuse me to not use Dylan in that area. Right. Well, I mean, it's fine. But so it's like this. There's a couple of things. One is if you get into an issue with Dylan, like something doesn't go right, then the petitioner can also revert your visa. Structurally wise, how it works is we serve as U.S. agent for multiple employers. So Dylan would just have to send us like we'd make an email form or in a support letter at the end to say, but we authorize Innovative Global Talent Agency to serve as petitioner and none of their activities conflict with what we have going on. And then That's pretty much it. So then that covers all the activities you're dealing with dealing. but then we can bake in like your own. So if you wanted to start your own business and have an LLC here to where you do your own projects, then you can do that. In addition to whatever employer partners that we have to replace you with, that you can do that as well. So it's more like you have all three options there. But the other reason is like, you know, the first one is just like sometimes over to, a lot can happen over three years. And then, you know, if somebody is holding your visa that, might use it as leverage over you, then you're back at square one. Yeah, I mean, that one I had zero concern about. Cool. But I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to do my own work. Oh, yeah, we can do that. No, we can do that. We just have to write it in. We just have to write it in. Yeah, you can do your own work. We just have to write that in. Yeah, but you're using Dylan as a sponsor. Yeah, we can use that as a sponsor, yeah. So I guess that is important. No problem. To do other sponsorships that I focus on and being able to do my own work outside of this company while in the U.S. Definitely a key part of it. Yeah, that's no problem. Whatever you want to do, you'll put it in your intake sheet and tell the drafting team as they're doing it so they include it in there. So that would be poker playing, your own business, and then the one with Dylan. And if you have something else that you might come up, put that in there, too, so we can have it contemplated. OK. And so wait, so the USCIS has to approve each individual way that goes? No. No, they just approve it. They'll approve it all. together and that's why we kind of like throw it all in there but your relationship with dylan yeah your relationship with dylan is actually like very good because it shows a tangible thing you know like it's like oh this is actually there and then we kind of throw the other more speculative stuff in there too but they approve it all it's not like they go one through one so you can do this if you can't they do it all together okay um and okay so like we we talked on um you know obviously the trophy's awards using a high level placement um and then we talked on um Yes. What we'll do is we'll use a lot of the data scientists. We'll use that for employment and critical capacity. We'll use that for original contributions. If it's happened to win awards like Will Dillon, we can use that as comparable evidence for awards. Renumeration, we can use your winnings as a poker data scientist doing winnings, not regular poker players. And then we'll make other comparable evidence, just kind of talking in general how rare it is of some of your skill set, and then put the public policy argument in there as well, as of, like, wow, the Biden administration is trying to push through data scientists. And that's, like, a verifiable thing. Yep. Because they have an overarching thing. Yeah, we have to include an overall arching story because it is a totality. Even if you meet the categories, you still have to meet the totality. So we make that recommendation. Yeah, I feel like, you know, I have the internal concern that none of the areas are that good on their own and they all work together, which obviously... At the end of the day, I would understand. I'm still a very fucking unique individual. Right. I mean, it's even more straightforward. We just did one for a basically operations manager of racing. He doesn't race anything. There's no press on him. And it's actually less of a straightforward thing than you are. But getting the job title correct brings down what is what they're expecting as far as like evidence they're not expecting you to have a you know gold medal for poker data science you know yeah It's purely to make sure Yeah, no offense taken. Go ahead. Yeah, I like it. It's all good. Yeah. And so I was about to say, the general vibe I get from it is that, you know, when you go on this composite list, people can try to, like, they can be viewed as someone, like, clawing for traps, trying to, like, you know, use something they can possibly get. Is that a real narrative or not? You're saying somebody trying to throw the kitchen sink? i think yeah uh well I mean kind of they don't really look at it in the brief too much the arguments you're making the thing is like if you throw in you know 300 pages of press evidence and I could see them getting annoyed by that um but usually on a brief if it's well presented and then the gill law firm which is like the firm that it goes under is really adamant about keeping as less pages as they can pretty succinct uscis seems to like that I've seen it like in the past they started getting more annoyed with just including page of pages of like the same evidence which some people do but on the brief itself um it's not it's not a bad thing that makes sense yeah I think someone someone saying that they're approved visa I mean 100 pages something Which my assumption would be, I can't get 100 pages of briefs. How many pages can you get 100 pages of? Is that pretty much it? I mean, we used to send men with 200, 300. But I mean, I don't know who's the brief. Your brief might be 20 pages, and then you might have 60 pages. I don't know. It might be the forms and stuff. In some ways, 100 pages is nothing, including forms and a brief. If he's talking about just... document pages it could be average you know but usually a lot of these you know we see like 200 uh to 300 on the uh acceptance side yeah okay so they can be yeah yeah but they they don't seem to ship about the brief okay that's fair enough um uh yeah I guess uh I i guess we thought that we're ready And I guess I want a little bit more clarification on the idea that I am not . Oh, no issue. No issue there. Now, remember, everything is under the lens of poker, computer, data, professional. Poker, computer, data, professional. It's not the composite. So that's not going to be good for us. Yeah. I mean, I guess it's the reason why, you know, since the message here, I thought, you know, one of the people is going to hire to get, you know, you can do it around. And, you know, it's good to see that difference. I guess, on that front, like, you know, obviously, it's like, what, 80-95% ? As well. we're saying that they're at least 85 likely yes I'm saying for me it's like you know it's like kind of shooting the high end of things for the professional like you know right under having like a gold medal or a world title as far as Professionally how it goes and being able to shrink the the job title very very good very very straightforward Yes, sir My confusion I was mostly gained from talking to someone else. I was very ready to go forward with you guys and change the tools. I guess I gained this misinformation to the point that this idea of like, And all of a sudden, you guys have just done this. Yeah, and that's something that you need to look at. It's like you really get to set your own job title. And, you know, you've got mind readers. You've got right-hand palm readers. You know, we've seen all types of job titles in this thing, you know. Combat sports media. Usually the uncertainty would be on itinerary. It's something that they push back on. But since you already have a bona fide job to do and they're serving as your employer, on the itinerary side of things like for example fighters that don't have any bout contracts or you know freelancers that don't have any like uh invoices out stuff like that but but since your petitioner is uh you know the one doing a project with you along with um the other things you'll be doing uh that looks that's taken care of I guess I'm purely worried about what you seem extremely confident on, which are obviously the trophies and stuff, which, I mean, once you narrow it down, this makes sense. And I guess really what is holding on to my concern at the moment is we're saying that I'm a top data scientists with like the computer scientists with what I, you know, do with collecting tools. And I guess like the proof behind that is not. How do you go around proving like the contributions, because like, I don't know, like the complex stuff, I'm not sure if I'm really allowed to talk about it. And you're saying a very brief outline. So this was helpful. If you say that, you know, And at the end of the client privileges, exactly like what you're doing. So we know what it is. Then we can work around that and kind of allude to the first part without saying exactly what it is. And then also when we write the letters for the people to prove things, we can have it in mind, right? So we know what the secret sauce is. It's under attorney client privilege. And then we can use that to be vague about it. you know distinct when we make our arguments to uscis and then when the letters go out um your contacts won't be alerted like hey like why are you giving out the secret sauce they'll know you know like hey this speaks in general terms like what you're up to says what it's why it's important and then it doesn't give away any of the data deals data tables that's me combining data and detail together very cool yeah yeah it almost sounds too easy against his mind I guess it's uh I don't know like I said it's like it's all we do so you know we're probably talking different than everybody else yeah yeah um One other issue, and I think you'll see, I'm going to mention it, but it's probably out there again. The U.S. border issues in Texas, I just agree with every time you're on it, because they thought I was trying to work there. Yeah. Is that going to become an issue during this at all? No. Do you have a problem with it? No, no. So like, one, oh, ones are dual intent. So you can go to the consulate and say, like, hey, I plan to permanently live in the United States. And they can't stop you for that. Like, you know, oh, one is the highest level of nonimmigrant visa we have in the United States. And it's like one of those things where we're looking for meet more people like that. So No, you won't have a problem over the consulate, consular issues with that. So like, once your visa stamp with a 01, you're, you're good to go. Plus that's going to be, so your 01 gets approved by USCIS. And then you go to the department of state for your visa stamp, which is kind of different from CPB, the border patrol guys, the border patrol guys to see your 01 stamp and be like, okay, no, there's nothing they could do. Um, and then I'm going to be like, you know, No, you probably won't even have an interview because you've already been to the United States on ESTA. There'll probably be the case that you can just send your passport in and then they'll stamp it and send it back to you. Yeah. yeah certain countries if you've already been to the united states successfully on esther or visitor visa you're going to work visa they um waive the interview so because they're trying to stop their backlog know so they're like oh you've already been vetted and you prove that you will come back to the home country so yeah yeah okay that's what I'm worried about yep that's all they're worried about really um This is pretty much exactly what I wanted to say around it. And I appreciate the ability to do this and have it concluded and done what it is. And this is handy, and it just means that obviously we can't have it closed now, and it'll be much less later on. But yeah, that was handy. I don't really have that many other questions left actually. I see one question is around, we do three years and we get all of them at the rehabilitation. If you had to continue up the building, would that be very straightforward out of that process of rehabilitation connected to just one spot every year? as it stands now it's a new application so it used to be that if you wanted one year we can send you an approval notice and say you want one year with a form and then they'll give you one year without us having to do anything but now you have to redo like everything so it's another submission you do get the benefit of the doubt of still being eligible because go poke holes in itinerary so we just created this new petition and we say you might as well do it for three years again because they're not they're not behaving the same way today um as they used to when they're doing those one year renewals yeah yeah around like The only time we can see issues is in combat sports. I think they have some stuff going on, but it's like on an itinerary stuff. There's nothing else. Everything else we see is pretty Pretty straightforward. Well, not straightforward, but whatever tactics that we use and do our adjustments are working great, especially in the professional spaces. Yeah, that's really all the comments for us. So these types of panelists, I mean, you mentioned the coach before, the operations manager. And so these types of like, I always think as you're, I know you originally thought, yeah you talk about what doing um for people in operations that kind of thing and executives and like on the professional side like not athletes yeah because we do like visas for like entire leagues or even like national teams a lot of times we'll base the process on o1s that are with the um kind of executives and workers rather than like the talent itself sometimes like say for example doing a visa for the boxing federation of uzbekistan a lot of times we'll get a visa for um their media spokesperson under o1b and then we can get like after that's the other thing if you have people that you want to bring in oh Since you're at, well, maybe, but maybe not. It won't work because you're under O1A. But like, say, for example, like we put you under O1. Well, you know what? It might actually work since you are, you know what? You brought a good point. I'm glad you brought that up. Usually under O1A, we can't get a central support staff, O2 visas. But since you're a poker player, we can say like they're supporting. Pardon your words. so yeah yeah there's a chance that you can get you know buddies or people that you work with or extended family members oh two visas um based on your o1 approval and you can do multiple applications like we've done like 20 people on the same I wouldn't recommend that like you're probably attracted with like three or four at a time and make sure that they you know really do something for you but it's something we use to get like girlfriends in and you know honestly yeah um yeah I don't even know but uh Yeah, is there any chance that increases chances of success? Which one? The O2s? Yeah, if you're applying for an O1A and having an O2, does that increase chances of success or does that reduce chances of success? I think in your case, to wait. Wait, because there's, like, we'd have to make the argument of like, okay, is this person for poker playing or is it for this? And so it's better to just get your set first. And then when we come back, we can say, you know, so like, okay, we're getting this O2s based on the athletic, you know, the poker playing part of this, even though they can be data scientists. He needs his other data scientists with him to help him, you know, calculate how he's going to do what he does. But then meantime, they can help you with those other projects too, you know? Yeah. yeah um yeah I guess like there's obviously this idea that the other ones are really hard to get um and yeah yeah like you know it's probably 20 000 people 23 000 people a year get them um and so it obviously can't be you know insanely extremely expensive well no that's not so true because you gotta think there's there's a lot of people that of them um people with world medals and stuff like that so you know there's certain professions that don't have other ways to go and it's just kind of understood so like you know there's thousands of them there's thousands of them that get like the you know the the regular hollywood stuff you know yeah yeah yeah all right um and so just to talk on the finance actually the question You said it's good to go now at the moment before the administration changes. And so I said the two expedited answers and then the non-expedited. You can do non-expedited and then you can always add expedited if you need it. But, you know, right now the new administration wouldn't take take seat until January. right, even though our elections are in November 6th. So under regular processing, you should be about to get a decision. Before then, you know, if something comes up, you can always add a premium process. All right. So a lot of that depends on you. Like, usually drafts are turned around in, like, you know, 10 days or so. But they come back and say, like, hey, we have some homework for you. Then, you know, that depends on you getting it back to them, and they get it back to you. But in general, they're trying to help us in the A cycles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that would be right. The team, the team's writing pretty good. And, yeah, you're not going to get it right before cricket season here. Cricket season is crazy. So now is a good time. that is it in the u.s yeah new uh u.s master p10 that uh it's like like retired guys but a lot of them are like you know like superstars I know you follow quickly I'm british but not really well there's a lot of indian nationals here uh I think there's more interest since we like kicked somebody's I think it's Pakistan with the U.S. World Cup. I mean, the UCC World Cup was here. And, yeah, we kicked somebody's ass. But, like, IT guys. These guys have full-time jobs doing tech. They might have been data scientists. I don't know. I don't know. But, no, these guys, this league is owned by a guy named Shahjian Mook, who is Indian by descent. But he has, like, this $4 billion company. And like, I'm not sure how profitable they are, but they get all the old stars like Suresh Raina, Irfan Pappan, and some stuff like that. And they come and do their tournament in November. They're supposed to have their draft in two days. But it's okay. Okay. I just wanted to find a question just to clarify on worst case scenarios, because I mean, that's just what I'm trying to cover my ass for. We had the 10K payment, and then P1 is the 0-1 fee. It was just for filing fees. That's right, just for filing fees. Yep. And the other one was, you said, if it's free, I was going to reapply for the 0-1, 2K. Is that correct? That's it, yeah. Yeah. And would that be like, oh, okay, I'll wait a year? Would it be, you know, I don't know. Might as well be immediately. Like, we just kind of see, because, you know, we just kind of see, like, what the discrepancy was, you know. Unfortunately, there's human beings on the other side of the equation, and, you know, sometimes they don't know what they're doing. Very rarely. Okay, fair enough. And so sometimes it's just, like, even if she wouldn't just get to the end of the line. sometimes but usually it happens very less now it was like a little concerning period but now it's happening it's happening less that like that's what I was saying with combat sports it was just baffling but it's really confined to combat sports yeah and so like those areas just turn up in different industries and you don't know why they're projected for a while until you figure out the right narratives um yeah or just like the officer that's doing that gets like corrected you know by the system I don't know if you can see it. Okay, let's undo ",,,,,
Aug.15.2024,Sherrod Seward Speaks on Self Petitioning as Entrepreneur under O-1A visa,Petitioner Services,Sherrod Seward Speaks on Self Petitioning as Entrepreneur under O-1A visa,Sherrod Seward Speaks on Self Petitioning as Entrepreneur under O-1A visa.mp4,Sherrod Seward Speaks on Self Petitioning as Entrepreneur under O-1A visa.mp3,"For entrepreneurs that have aspirations of doing and handling their business hands-on in the United States, There is a common belief that O-1 is not a great option for these entrepreneurs. And I beg to differ and think that it's a great one. Traditionally, entrepreneurs that want to do their craft in the United States use visa categories such as the E-2, Trader Investor Visa, the L-1, Intra-Company Transfer Visa, and the EB-1As. if they're going for permanent residence, and EB-5 to do their craft in the United States. But all of these have limitations, and some of them just take a long time. And many of them do not support someone that wants to have a job and do their craft on the side, or if they have multiple businesses that they want to run. A lot of these solutions are tied to one business and might not even permit the foreign national to be hands-on. on the business and really rely on other workers to service that. That's not the case with the O-1. With the O-1 visa, you can be hands on your business. There is no requirement to hire anybody else to run it for you. But there are some limitations to when you are serving as a petitioner for yourself. In order for it to work as a self petitioner, that means you as your own business sponsoring yourself as a foreign national to do the O-1A, you must establish an employer employee relationship. which means that one, either you have to give up a significant amount of ownership in the business so that somebody has the authority to fire you, or you have to hire a board that has the authority to make those decisions for you. But there is a way around that that I found in my practice time as an immigration attorney and now as the managing director of Innovative Global Talent Agency. That's when you use a third party entity to serve as the petitioner. So there's someone to receive service of process that is not the individual. The way that we structure this correctly is that we serve as the petitioner for the visa. We add building the business that you want to do or the businesses as part of your itinerary. And then if you have a job, we can place that job as part of the itinerary too. With this being the case, since there's a third party involved, you no longer have the problem of accepting service of process on your own entity, and you are free as a foreign national to own 100% of your business without a board and operate several businesses at the same time, and even potentially have a full-time employment or various projects that you work on. so that's what I have to present about how the o1 can be the most flexible non-immigrant visa for entrepreneurs when structured properly with a third-party petitioner hopefully us innovative global talent agency I hope you find us helpful out there and we look forward to further educating the market on how to use o1 visas to do amazing things have a great day",,x,x,,

Currently, I am building a talent agency that used to just serve as a petitioner when our clients did not have another alternative. I've decided that I kind of like doing this business more than the traditional uh immigration and so I'm going to shut down the operations of the law firm and do this full time and I'm reaching out to you because I'd love to be a resource for your clients that are p and o visa petition uh beneficiaries but do not have a petitioner or they might have a situation where we might be a better option than the petition they have in mind we come in and to be helpful in a variety of services. One, for athletes that do not have a petitioner, we have a great relationship with sports organizations all over the United States. We help place them and find sponsorships. For graduating students that might not have a job lined up or were a casualty to the H-1B cap, If you deem them worthy of an O-1, we can place them as petitioners, and we have a couple services we do for them. For one, if they're interested in starting their own business, we can serve as a petitioner that gives them the freedom to own 100% of their company. We also do placements at various job employers that we maintain relationships, and we also have projects to where we can fulfill an itinerary that will help support an O-1 petition. We also do these same services for professionals that are already in the field and maybe want to come to the United States or already here on H1B and want more flexibility or more options. We can change these persons to 01 or you can and we can serve as petitioner to where we can go ahead, place them, allow them to run their own business. They can still maintain a relationship with their current employer if they want to by incorporating that into the itinerary. There's a lot of flexibility and options that we can offer to your clients by working with us. And since I'm formerly an immigration attorney that specializes in these categories, I know how to present our structure side on the contract and itinerary to present it to you to do your job more efficiently. So I hope that you find this in good spirit and helpful to your clients and hopefully talk to you soon. Thank you very much.",,x,x,,
Aug.15.2024,Sherrod Seward Speaks on Agent Based Visas for Major League Sports,Immigration Sports,Sherrod Seward Speaks on Agent Based Visas for Major League Sports,Sherrod Seward Speaks on Agent Based Visas for Major League Sports.mp4,Sherrod Seward Speaks on Agent Based Visas for Major League Sports.mp3,"hello I hope all is well with you and uh thank you for paying your attention to this uh video uh that I'm going to make pretty short uh if we're not already familiar with each other my name is sherrod seward and I'm a pretty much exclusively a sports based immigration attorney and I was reaching out to you to discuss the concept of agent-based visas and concurrent visas for the international players in your league You know, it's typical that athletes, foreign athletes will get their visa placed with the team for their appointment with for however long they're going to be with them. But there is the reality that a lot of these players are not going to be with the team long term. And when their visa expires with the team, when they are cut or some other reason, they have to leave the team. A lot of times they have to also leave the United States because there is no other status for them to switch to. But there is an opportunity that if a visa is going to be placed at all, that they can use the agent based structure where the team doesn't hold the petition, but there is a third party that doesn't have to be their sports agent, but it could be any entity that they are comfortable with. hold the visa so that when the team cuts them, they still have that visa in place to go and pursue other opportunities and also remain vigilant for other opportunities. For example, we had an NFL player that was cut by the Chargers and it was during the middle of the season and he was unable to join another team because they didn't want to hold up a roster spot while they're waiting to get him a visa. So we were able to place a visa with this agent and the team only provided an interest letter email saying that they would like him to play for the team. And he was actually able to play for two teams on that same visa. We've done this on P1 for a quarterback and we've done it a couple of times for kickers who notoriously have short training camp stints if they're not to the active roster in the NFL. But another concept that there is is a concurrent visa, which means if someone has a P1 visa already, they can get another visa on top of that for multiple years as placed with the third party entity. So they'd have a visa with the team and the visa. The team would just need to say that one, they have no objection to the athlete getting a petitioner to do. And then they would need to have that itinerary with the original team put into that new itinerary. So a third party would make a petition, include whatever they're supposed to do with the team, and then say they'll also be doing things after that. They don't need to be set in stone, but just that concurrent visa gives them the protection while they have the eligibility that they can stay for multiple years on it. and be immediately available for other opportunities. In addition, if they happen to have other people assigned to those visas, they have family members, they might have support staff that are assigned to those visas, those people also get the same protection of knowing that if something happens with the relationship with that particular team, the whole structure of how they have their authorization to be in the United States does not immediately change by that impact. I hope this has been helpful and I look forward to educating and being of use to you in the future. Thank you very much.",,x,x,,
Aug.15.2024,Visa Options Poker Player on ESTA - What to do,Immigration Sports,Visa Options Poker Player on ESTA - What to do,Visa Options Poker Player on ESTA - What to do.mp4,Visa Options Poker Player on ESTA - What to do.mp3,"Hello, this is attorney Sherrod Seward responding to an inquiry we got about a P-one visa for a poker player from Australia that's in town on an ESTA visa waiver. The number one thing we need to address is eligibility. In this case, this poker player has a pretty good ranking, and they also have a couple hundred thousand dollars in winnings and going up, so that's pretty good. With that, we can usually work backwards to establish eligibility for the P-one in poker, which is really banked off the ranking, but we could also do it based off of the money won in a particular year or big placements in some of the bigger tournaments. The second thing we need to address is getting the visa applied to the passport or just adjusted of status. So in this case, since the person is from Australia and has traveled on an ESTA visa waiver, we need to either do the consular processing Well, yeah, either way, we have to do consular processing. And that's because when you come on an ESTA waiver, it is a waiver of needing a visa. So there's no visa for us to change you into. If you would have come on a visitor visa, then we can change from B-one to P-one. But in this case, we can apply for the P-one while they're in the United States or out. And then when it's approved, they'll need to leave the United States in order to get the passport applied. Well, the P-one applied to the passport. No need to go all the way to Australia to do it. Usually for Australians, we'll have them go to Toronto, where there's a pretty quick wait to get a visa appointment under P-I or O-I, and they're usually pretty good about giving expedited interviews. That's because a lot of Native Canadians do not need interviews in these categories. They simply just go to a point of entry, especially when it's by airplane, and just get it applied to their passport without an interview. since that's the case a lot of third country nationals have a great time at toronto consulate uh getting their quick interviews and p one applied to their passport so to reiterate one eligibility is good because there's good winnings a couple hundred thousand dollars There's some pretty good tournament placements and there is a decent enough global ranking on the index to support eligibility. The next thing is they will need to consult process because there is no visa in place on the visa waiver to adjust from. uh the third thing to think about is if you have a petition in the united states that is a company or a united states citizen that can sign off on your immigration paperwork if there's none there there's plenty of services such as innovative global talent agency which can serve as the petitioner for a fee and hold the visa paperwork for you while you do your thing and we hope to hear back and I hope this is helpful to the people out there thank you very much",,x,x,,

Uh, just to recap, you were on major leagues cricket and they gave you a P one visa that did not have a lot of validity time on it. And you're looking to extend for multiple years on the agent based basis. Just to remind you, uh, we can do that and we have a petitioner service, innovative global talent agency that can serve as the petitioner for your visa. And then we can have it in your schedule to put in whatever type of leagues that you want to play in, whether it be the minor league, cricket league or the major league. Or just we can just put all of them along with some of the club team aspirations that you want to do. And we can do that under the P-one. If you're interested in doing other things than competing, we can look at the O-one visa for you, which will allow you to do coaching, do seminars, open businesses around cricket if you'd like. and some other things that might be advantageous to you to take advantage of. But I just wanted to say, yes, we can serve as petitioner. You can play for multiple leagues for multiple years, three years on that. The petitioner service usually is two thousand dollars. And then there's the legal fees for the one visa. And Yes, you are a great candidate from already playing in the Cricket League, the Major League Cricket, so it shows that you're eligible for the P-One, and we can do it for multiple years.

Today we're talking about track and specifically athletes that are looking to transition out of their F-one status and going on in their life and what they can do with that in the track and field. In this case, we understand that the situation is we have a Caribbean sprinter that's had an excellent career in the Big Twelve. but they've also had a great international career for their country, even appearing in the two thousand twenty Olympics, which is great. And the question is, are they eligible for a P one visa? And then I'm bringing in the situation. Is there another visa category that might be more appropriate? So, track and field is one of those situations where if you have a world ranking, you've been in the NCAA, you're kind of by default eligible for the P-one part of it. And then on itinerary, there's plenty of races that USCIS deems worthy of needing internationally recognized athletes. So in this case, it's pretty straightforward. The question would be, does the athlete have a petitioner? That means there needs to be someone In the United States, usually an individual citizen or an entity that can sign off on the visa paperwork for my one twenty nine. If there isn't someone there that the athletes are comfortable with doing that, we do have an affiliated talent agency which can serve as the petitioner for this purpose. And they don't get involved in your affairs. They just kind of hold the visa there. So you're going to have the three years of eligibility. Since this athlete does have Olympic olympic uh participation there's the opportunity to do the o-one visa the o-one visa is great because it's not limited to competition when you're on a p-one it's supposed to be solely used for competition and maybe getting paid sponsorships however if you're a track and field athlete on an o-one then you can do a lot of other things such as make content you can start businesses on it you can do coaching you can do seminars it's a lot more flexibility when it comes to the work authorization And then, God forbid, if you get hurt, you will not be at risk of losing the visa because USCIS might see that you're not competing. The other thing that comes with both visas, and especially with the O-I, is you have the ability to get essential support staff, which can be coaches, it can be extended family members, it can be parents that might want to come to the United States and support you. But if you do it on a P-I, the first visa for that essential support staff will only be one year. But if you do an O visa, the O-two essential support staff visas will last for as long as yours are, which is three years. It does cost a little bit more to do the O-one-A because it's a bit more of a nuanced visa to process and a little bit harder work on the attorneys, but it might be a worthwhile investment depending on how much you can extricate from the additional activities you can do in addition to competing. And it's also a Great, great transition into the EB-I-A permanent residence if you want to become a green card holder in the United States because the arguments are pretty similar. But we're glad that we got this inquiry and we always are honored to work with Olympians. And this is both a great candidate for P-I and O-I-A. And now you know why.",,,,,

La France, bonjour. We do a lot of work for soccer players that are transitioning out of being a collegiate athlete and going into the pros and maybe not have a major league contract or a minor league contract with the football club right out the gate. That's no problem, depending on what category that they are applying for. That is a problem applying for a P-I if you do not have a current club at least interested in you that does require internationally recognized athletes. However, if you qualify for the O-I, then you do not need a club contract or interest letter in order to enjoy being able to stay in the United States with work authorization without having a team. In this case, the eligibility looks great because there is a good record of professional playing and most importantly, national team. We see that there's two national team caps at the senior level, and then there's also national team caps at the U-seventeen level and some success there. So usually when we have a good track record of national team ability in sports, that's a great, great, pretty much certain case for an O-A visa. We can use that for selection. We can use that for I mean, I'm sorry, for awards. We use that for membership. We can use that for employment in a critical capacity. And we there's usually some publishing about it. And then depending on what type of original contributions, goals, assists, things that have been brought to the table, maybe championships for the first time, we can use those as original contributions. So I'd like to officially say this is a great candidate for a one eight. And it's an excellent visa for football players, soccer, that are looking to stay in the United States with work authorization, but do not have a club team currently signing them up. So because of the national team caps, you are a great candidate for O-I-A. And I hope this is helpful for other soccer players out there. Thank you very much.",,,,,
Aug.15.2024,Azeem  _O-1,Client Correspondence,Azeem  _O-1,Azeem  _O-1.mp4,Azeem  _O-1.mp3,"Hello, this is Attorney Sherrod Seward, and I'm giving an evaluation of the EB-A for cricket. I saw that you were very, very accomplished, especially in your youth national team. That is the kind of thing that goes very well for both the O-I and the EB-A. Originally, I thought that this was a candidate for O-A, so I didn't evaluate the EB-O option. But both of the categories have similar eligibility categories. And your skill set and background are a great, great candidate for both of them. The reason being is the national team caps and how successful those national teams were. and from what country you were doing it, which of sure, as everyone knows, is one of the most strongest countries in cricket. So now I want to talk about processes and options. With the O-one, you have the opportunity to get a work visa for three years, and we have a petitioner service that can help serve as a sponsor for the petition. Even if you don't currently have a job set yet, there's ways around that to where you can be put with jobs. The O-one tends to be adjudicated a little bit less stringently than the EV-A, but the other thing it does is timing. If you're not currently in the United States, then you can get here much quickly with the O-one and then apply for the EV-A down the line. Now, if you are sure that you want to do EV-A, which is great in this case because you have such eligibility that you're likely to get approved for that as well from our previous experience, is that if you're not in country, then you can use regular or premium processing for your EB-A. With regular processing, you can expect to get responses back in eight months, maybe a little bit longer. With premium processing, you can get responses back in fifteen business days. Once your case is approved under EB-A, next you'll need to schedule an interview if you're not already in the United States to have that apply. The interviews come on on a as available basis. So EB-A's tend to have a much faster timeline than some of the other green card based petitions. We wait for one of those to become available and then we help you schedule your interview at the consulate. There's a separate fee for that part of it, which will be discussed at that time and a fee for the government fee. Now, if you are in the United States applying for the EB-A and on a B-I visa, we would still probably caution using the O-I just so you can have more time in case something goes wrong. And then if you did want to go right for the EB-A, you can also do adjustment of status, which comes with work authorization and waiting for advanced parole. But we do think you're a good candidate for EB-A, so you can go ahead and start the process. Thank you very much.",,x,x,,

This is Sherrod Seward. I mean, you know who I am. Sorry, I'm just so used to doing recordings. What I was saying is for the job candidates, we're starting to get a lot of candidates coming in and we need to have something to do. For them to go to the next step, and that should be we should presenting them a questionnaire that asked them more questions to make sure they are good at what they do and ask them about the work authorization what locations, they would like to work on working in have them give us some notes on what they would like. If we have opportunities come up, because basically we have jobs that don't really exist. So we want to figure out where they want to go, how high they are in their skill set, what type of salary they're looking for, what locations they would go to, and some notes to help us place them in the future and to know if they have work authorization or will need it. So what I want you to do is for each job posting that we have is go ahead and make a list of questions. Present them to me first. That would be good to ask all these candidates to figure out how good they are. Do they need work authorization? What locales would they like to live? Specific notes about them. then if anything else comes up that you think is helpful to make that as well and just put that in a list of questions so there should be some technical questions and then personal questions and then visa questions for each one so just make a new google doc that has the job listing and then your prospective questions for each one of those and we'll go from there thank you very much",,,,,

This is my first day of doing calls. Hello. This is my first day of doing calls. It's a Hampton thing. I'm a little nervous, but I'm going to get into it first. I'm going to try to call three companies in three different cities each, and then I'll move on to schools and then move on to attorneys. All right. So here I am going to call some companies. I'm going to pause it in between. All right. I'm getting ready to call this person a registrar court. It looks like they do food and beverage online training, things like that. Um, Here's the contact information. Let's see what we can get. You can see that they five five five pieces. Hello, my name is Sharon super open, this is the correct content. I am formerly an immigration attorney, but I've started a talent agency where we have kind of a unique approach where we obtain the visas instead of the employer getting them through a method we call the O-1 visa. And I'm calling up for like a hard sales assistant, kind of new to the talent agency as opposed to, you know, very familiar with being a law firm. And I was looking to see if I can meet with somebody for proof of concept and tell them about our unique structure while I'm in town later this week. So either way, you're the contact or maybe I can be forwarded to the correct contact. Again, this is Sherrod Seward, former immigration attorney, now a recruiting agency where we obtain visas for high skilled workers before they are employed. So we just kind of keep a talent pool of talent. But I'd like to talk to you about our concept and get your feedback to see if it works for you and just to get feedback on the idea itself. You can reach me at this number, which is 980-403-6587. 980-403-6587. Thank you very much. So we're about to get to the next one. The first one, depending on how it is. Chief Technology Officer at Mattysoft. Let's see what Mattysoft is. Why are they giving me a whole thing? I don't like that. So there are technology solutions, IT services. We're in Houston, Texas. I don't know why they gave me that, but that's all right. We'll call them anyway. So I don't appear to be in Virginia. I got that. So I'm going to use this. All right. So now I'm going to give him a call. Hope there's not too much noise in the background. So I hope there's not too much noise in the background. Huh? Can you wait till I do this phone call? Yes. I'm dialing the number. It won't take long, probably. I can see they filed 41 visas. Hello, I was looking to see if I can leave a message or speak with Ramesh Mahdi. He's on another call. Oh, well, I'm a talent agency and also an immigration attorney. I was coming to town and wanted to kind of introduce our concepts. Uh, we do a lot of Oh ones and then we just do the visa work and the employer does not have to do anything with it. And so we're just trying to educate people on our thing. Okay. You promise. That's another email. Okay, cool. Thank you. So that one, she basically said, send him email. I'm not going to be in Houston that time anyway. All right. Then I'll just copy this and send it to him. The other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to mark down that I called him. So as I do my call list, I'm just going to do this. Sent a... So that way I can easily track down like what I did and who I called at the end of the day without having to do so much other stuff. So I'll pause this. All right, we're ready for the next person. First, I looked them up their company. They're in Alpharetta, Georgia. I'm hoping to call people in like Raleigh and stuff like that, but it's not working out so well. That's not a big deal. We'll get to that next after I call these people. So first thing I'm gonna do is look them up on LinkedIn so we can get some contacts of me. I don't think that it's him unless he's had his own company. Oh, copy this guy anyway. All right, so we can't do that. So let's just call him Raj XR. Raj Jessica, Mr. Blue condom. Blue condom is called Mr. Bone condom. Right then about the call. Hello. May I speak to Mr. Bulukonda? How are you doing today? My name is Sherrod Seward. I'm formerly an immigration attorney, but I have a talent agency and I was going to be in your area and I want to see if I can send you some information about what we do that's a little bit different. I see that you filed H1Bs before, but what we do is we specialize in O1s and we get that without the employer involved on an Asian-based basis. So it's like kind of like subscribe to us and then we're always getting talent that have o1s ready to go and then you don't have to be involved in the visa process and so we're just reaching out just and uh educate the market and see um get feedback honestly to make sure it's a great idea they say you're not looking for o1as or more more eat stuff or more people no so So just to be clear, we don't make you get the O1As. We're always just art. So since I'm a former immigration attorney, Our talent agency is getting the O1As all the time, right? So we're going to like the best schools, getting the best O1A talent. And then what we're saying is what we can do is for people that are subscribed with us, we do what's called US agent for multiple employers. And so whoever subscribed for us can be a multiple employer and get access to the talent without filing a visa. We do all the visa work, no cost to the employer. Exactly. So good. So as a background, I practice O-1 visas primarily in sports, like for a lot of high level boxing Olympians. And the way it works usually is we get an O-1 visa on a talent, like on an agent basis. And then whoever they happen to fight for, they serve as the employer. But a lot of times it'll be us as an agent that gets the visa. And so that way the promoter doesn't have anything to do with that. And for us, the way we were able to do it is there's a subscription that we have with our employer partners so that we can show USCIS that the work is not uncontemplated. So, for example, if you were doing an H-1B, right, you would have to advertise the job and do all things like that. On the O-1 visa, you don't have to do that as long as we have the subscription with you. so it's the same thing that's like if we're doing a visa for a model or if we're doing a visa for an actor that has multiple you know shows that they'll be doing we're using the same concept but we're just applying it for like i.t services we're using it for physicians and things of that nature and the way it works is if you subscribe to us and then you like one of the talent or you might have somebody that you like but you don't want to deal with the visa work You can kind of send it to us. And then if they work in our model, we work with them. So we get the visa and we bring them back. And then it works like a talent agency placement with if you're happy with them over 45 days. That's when we get like a fee based on the salary, not on whether we got the visa or not, because you wouldn't be involved in the visa process. Oh, so you're saying you're a relatively new company? Okay. Well, tell me this. Would you be interested at least if you have people that you like? One thing is we like getting talent. So if you have job placements and you're like, man, I really like this guy, but we just don't want to deal with the visa process, we'd like to just be preferred candidates, honestly. We're always looking for good people. So if you get people that come to you that want to work, even if you say that you don't want to work with them, but they're good, We wouldn't mind you referring them to us so that we can see if we can help. And maybe in the future, you'll be in the market. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'll send you an email. Yeah. I'll send you an email and then you can schedule me later. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I will. I'll send you an email. I have it already. My name is Sherrod. Sherrod Seward. Yep. Thank you. All right, so in this call, Sihai walking through, he said basically he's just starting. He doesn't know if he can afford everything. So what I'm going to do is send him a follow-up saying like, hey, this is my contact where you can schedule a conversation with me anytime. Also, we'd like to be introduced to your law firm because they seem to do a lot of good work. Then that's going to be a by the way. So that was a good call. So I'm going to show you the follow-up. Oops. So I'll show you how I switch up this follow-up, boom. And I'm gonna send it from Innovative Global Talent. I'm going to say, great speaking with you. Here is a link to schedule conversation. Me anytime. I think that's right. Let me make sure. William, how do you think that call went? I think so. um I'm coming, Joshua, so you can hopefully like follow up. All right. So this one looks pretty good. All right. So let me pause the recording and we'll get to the next one. OK, I'm about to send a message to someone. I don't have their phone number. I don't think I have them pending here. Let's see if I know anybody I know. Mike Garner. Grant. No, we don't know any of these people. But we'll send her an email. Oh, she wants to go by Kimberly, of course. Oh, I started writing one here so there's some say like I might say like I'm coming to town just saying seeking input. So. Then let's go to our template message. Persist to innovative global talent. I say I'm coming to town, but I'm really not. That's OK. Contact Joshua here. So you can be in the know. So I sent her a message. So what I'll do here is it's unlinked message on email. So that's when I don't have a phone number, but it's a good job. All right. I'm getting ready to do another call. a lady in Chicago. She is from the ladders.com one right here. And you can see that she's looking for data scientists and she's in executive recruitment and she's in Chicago. We've got a Gmail address for her. So first we're gonna pull up her LinkedIn, which we have already. Matt. I'm gonna say hello. Hello, everyone. I'm actually going to save that message too. That was a sweet LinkedIn message. Good job, Sherry. Oh. No, they didn't. Okay. So let's give her a call. See if she picks up. Okay. Yeah. No, no, not you. I'm getting ready to make a phone call. It's getting my nerves together. Her name is Ann O'Connor. So our phone number is 3... Do you want to call in to Google it? Her mailbox is full. Cannot accept messages. We're going to send her one anyway. I sent her the same one that I kind of sent the lady in Chicago. So let me go to sent. Liam, tell him we ain't scared. I don't know where Liam went. Oops. No. I'll get that right. Alright, this one's kind of a different one. I'm going to do a school call to one of the local schools here in Charlotte, basically saying we're a talent agency. We help students that are getting ready to graduate and we help get uh foreign talent for um for schools see that's real yeah let's show us the same guy so let's give a call to literal right now I'm on my visa jobs I can see that they filed for three kind of green cards right here so let's get on the phone and give them a call The number is not in service. That's right. So we'll just give them a proof of concept. But I'm in there. Oh, sorry. I said no chairs for Jesus. Then we'll kind of tell you this. See how good it is? Probably not. Uh-huh. All right, copy Joshua. We'll send that off. Mark that I sent him a message. Where am I marking off at? Oh, paste unlinked. Let's go ahead and pause that. All right. We're going to do another school call. I already went and added this person. And we're going to give them a call and then send them a follow-up message if they don't pick up. Okay. Hello, my name is Sherry Seward. I'm a former immigration attorney that now has a talent agency where we do special things with the O-1 visa for both faculty and also international students that are graduating at the graduate college level. I was given a call to give you a heads up that I'll follow up with an email, but I'm going to be in your area this week and like to introduce myself and also kind of introduce the concepts and get your feedback on how we think our talent agency can be of great service to schools and for the international students. once they're looking to graduate.

I've been meaning to get this video to you guys. I appreciate the work so far and I'm glad that you were able to connect to get on the same page about business development right now. The main thing that is needed is I need meetings. with folks. And I think the approach should be like, hey, not candidates. Well, you can leave with, we have some candidates you may be interested in, but it's also, we'd like to just have an informative conversation about what we do. Say we're kind of new to the field, started from immigration attorney that has a different concept of bringing talent without you having to deal with the visa side. And we just want to have a fifteen minute conversation, introduce a candidate and get some honest feedback about our concept. OK, so that's what we're looking to do. I'm going to be working on this counterintelligence one, this list. So let me worry about that. If you guys can work the ladders. LinkedIn jobs. and my visa jobs now john has already sent some here left voicemail I mean it's been a while since they've gone here but when you do contact somebody just put a note here as he uh did here which is a great job of sending a text and an email um all of these should have those tabs to keep track of the of who's making a conversation. Right, so here we have them here. So I'll work this list. If somebody can work this list and the LinkedIn jobs, we'll go from there. And then maybe next week we'll get back to the my visa job things. All right. If you have any questions, just contact me back. But the main thing we're trying to do is just get them to agree to have a ten, fifteen minute conversation. However that's done, we should try to be doing it on a more educational basis as opposed to just trying to hit them over the head with hardcore sales. All right, so let's do it and then let's regroup on Friday or so and talk about things.",,,,,

Jibo, I have something for you. We're going to bolster up our staffing capabilities by we put out some job posts. And what we need you to do is track those job posts in a spreadsheet that already exists. We just need you to put new job insurances in there. So that's what this says. We're going to have job posts coming in from Ladders, Indeed, LinkedIn, and maybe some other job boards. But they'll all go to the same email. We'll have those forwarded to you. What we need you to do is go in and log these emails and this job tracking thing. So here, you see that we have tabs already set for different job posts. So what I need you to do is make a new one for the job. So you can go, there's quite a bit of them. I think, yeah, you go all the way to the left to create a new one. Right. And when you do it, we want it like this job offer where we got it from, put the name of the person location, the resume. So you make a folder and put their actual resume in there. And we also want their LinkedIn profile. So also put the LinkedIn profile. So for example, if I'm making a new one, I'm going to go. Sorry, I have like a vision. The way the screens are set up is not ideal. So instead of sheet 27, I'm going to call this, rename it. And what I'll do is I'll log in. So when you sign in, you just do it with email address. So we have two of them. This is one of them. This is the one I want you to do today. Jaitlyn. And then say use sign-in code instead. It's going to send a sign-in code that I'll have sent to you as well. There it is. I'll have it so this can forward to you or just like send it to you. Copy that. Put it in here. So we have a couple of jobs that are already posted. Verification code. Okay. Where is this? All right, so that should be the verification code. Oh, it's for Seneca. I don't know what's going on with this. Wait for yet another code. There it is. I think it's because I didn't wait for the human validation. All right, so now we're in. So I want to cancel this. Now we're in. All right, so we go to candidates. And then we can go like per job. Yes, I hope so. All right, so here's the jobs that we have. All right, so for each of these, we'll start with this one at the top. We put ServiceNow Solutions Architect. So that's what goes here. What is it, ServiceNow? And so then we could kind of take this, we put this here, but also with resume, I want to say in certain columns to the right, LinkedIn profile. So this will always be. ServiceNow Solutions Architect. Website we got it from was Indeed. Lane. Lash Kumar. The location, they're in San Francisco. See if we can get a copy of the resume. Download the PDF. So you would download this to, I'll give you, I'll just give you an example. So we download that to PDF, file upload. watch when I find his we're gonna go to share and I make sure that anyone with link can edit so I copied a link and that goes with right here LinkedIn profile I'll go to LinkedIn It might actually already be on his resume. Moving on. That's Fumar ServiceNow. Sometimes it helps to put their See if that looks like it's him, it's not him. So sometimes we can't find it, look a little bit better. Let's see, email.

Question. all right let me say he has 10 years of experience there's notes right so we have that all right and then that's how we do that but I want you for all of these job posts so you see we have all these applicants here and go back to candidate and do it by job title. So just go through each job and then do it there. I don't know if we got anybody from Mr. Defense. No applicants yet. All right, so just do that for each of these job posts.

Aug.09.2024,IGTA Training - Rollin and Lanita -,Training Video,IGTA Training - Rollin and Lanita -,IGTA Training - Rollin and Lanita -.mp4,IGTA Training - Rollin and Lanita -.mp3,"all right basic review of the concept is we're using what we know in immigration to now do talent placement and a lot of times in talent placement they don't want anything to do with the visas but we know that there's a lot of companies that apply for 600 000 visas a year in h1b and that doesn't include the ones that would but they just don't want to mess with it so The basic thing we're trying to do is get the companies, whether they apply for visas or not, to get on a subscription service. Now, why would they do that? Because a lot of them pay recruitment agencies anyway, a retainer. That's a lot more than what we do to start the search. For us, If it's a fortune 2000 company, we're trying to get them to pay 10,000 a month to be on a subscription service, which does a couple of things. One is that's the, the subscription is the contract that allows us to not involve them in immigration process. We show that contract to USCIS and say like, Hey, we're the visa holders, but they're going to be working over here. Well, how do we do that? Well, we have a contract that shows that they pay us every month to bring us people in this industry. Any questions there? No. All right, and then the reason we came up with 10,000 is because that's the industry standard of what recruiters get paid for the ones that are a retainer to go look for a job description. So they used to pay in that per job description. All right, at the end of the day. This 10,000 is for 12 months. 10,000, yeah. And so if they push back and say, why is it 12 months? I'd be like, well, if I only show USCIS that we have a contract with you for two months, they might say like, well, we think that's speculative. But if I show it is for 12 months, that lets USCIS know that there is an itinerary for the persons that were getting visas to do stuff. So it's 10,000 per month for 12 months? Yeah. Okay. Right, and so what that allows them, it gets them one, we can only really do this with people we're under contract with to make sure we get consistent results with USCIS. Number two, they get access to our talent pool. So we're always looking for the best minds in the world that are eligible for O-1 visas and we're getting them the visas beforehand. So the people we're offering them are gonna have visas already set in place that they could start working like they're a regular American workers. And then number three is, if the employer is getting responses from foreign candidates that they like, but they're just like, we don't mess with visas, they can turn those people to us to be considered for getting a visa and brought back to them, right? For example, Wells Fargo, I'll show you. Just to show you, I'm not making it up. You know, I'll just pull up the sheet. I think we already have one contact list too. So my visa tax. Now look, this is Lowe's. So Lowe's, I can see that their attorneys are Fragilement. That's the firm that tried to recruit me a little bit. And I can see over here that they filed for 416 visas in H-1B. Now, mind you, there's only 18%. So if they filed for and got for 416, that means they really filed like two and a half thousand of them. So technically they've had people they've already recruited for, um, sent job offers and there's like 2000 of them that they didn't get it. So imagine them, they're like, oh, well, we can bring back the people that you've already said you wanted. We go get them visas and bring it back to you. Because they've already spent thousands, maybe even a million. So for filing that many visas, you're probably spending a million dollars. Right? So then to pay the $10,000 is nothing. But there's a lot like that. So with that $10,000 subscription, you're doing their visas. You always get so confused. Yeah, I don't know. He always asks that question. I don't get what he's... Okay, let me be clear. I thought it was pretty clear. For 10,000, what they do is they make it possible for us to do our job as far as getting the visas without them being involved. Yes. So we do the visas. Second, that gives them access to our talent pool so they can see who we have in process of doing visas for. Third, if they can give us the people that they're interested in, but they don't want to mess with their visa or it just didn't happen. Does that make sense? Yeah. So it's not necessarily, hey, here's $10,000, do all our visas. It's like, no, $10,000 is the subscription service to have access to the talent pool. Because if you tell them like- To the talent pool. No, and it makes it possible for us to include them in the people that have visas, right? So the way our model works under 01 is we really can only do it for people that are subscribed to us. So if you're not subscribed to us, we don't have the contract to show USCIS that they can anticipate somebody can work here. Right. And what if they decide to go with one of the people that you have a visa for? Now, does that change the price per month or is it still just flat rate? No, the subscription goes, but then we get our placement fee, which is industry standard. And for us, we're going to high end, we're going 30. We're going 30% placement fee. Okay. I was just thinking it was included in that T&K. I was like, that's not a lot of money. No, no, no, it's not. That's why I can't say that. Oh, you give us ten thousand dollars and we're doing all your visas. No, that's not how it works. What it is, is you get you get access to talent where you don't need to file visas. Right. Because it's not like you give me ten thousand dollars and I can go file a million dollars worth of visas. Right. Right. Right. But what you do get is, OK, now you don't have to work for visas for the people that we're bringing to you. They're fine, and we're actively recruiting the top minds in cybersecurity, data science, and medical consulting. And then it's like, if you have people that are replying to you that you can't mess with because they didn't get a visa or you just can't do it, send them to us, and maybe we'll put them in talent school and bring them back to you. And so even Wells Fargo filed 248 H-1Bs. So the only thing that I'm trying to get them to do at this point from you guys is I just want them to go to this link and then schedule time to talk to me. From there, I will close them and I will pay. I just need to get these meetings or even they want to meet in person. If they're in Charlotte, I will run up on them. You know what I mean? But I just need a meeting. It could be on the phone. I'll get on the Zoom. If they're in Charlotte or somewhere I happen to be traveling, I can say, hey, I'm going to Cincinnati. Hey, I'm going to Nashville. I get to meetings, I will pull up on them old school IRC style. And you're going to give us a script, right? Yes, I will give you a script. So, Here's one. So I'll give you a list of scripts, and I'm going to show you a little bit what they look like. So one is we have a lady that's pretty much in the program, and she's MI6, which means she's basically a CIA agent, but for like Britain, right? Now we have a list of defense contractors like Booz Allen, Boeing, you know, some others that would – that we would use her with this type of script to just get a conversation with them. Like, hey, we're working with a talent that is top secret clearance. They have been working in MI6 since they're 16 and are one of the best cyber intelligence, you know, people in the world, which is true. we use that to get in the door but then it's asked like but we have this unique way that we get it done where you won't have to get a visa for we're having that almost done let's have a conversation so that's one where like as we have people coming to the talent pool and I'll put this into a doc where you can copy and paste it right um we use that as the reason to have conversation with people just because we already have a candidate and we might know some people that have job posts for cyber security so we just use that to open a conversation now let's see is it in here Doo-doo-doo. Okay, so message to HR contacts. So here's another one where I'll make it so it's not coming from me, like it's coming from somebody talking about me. Basically like, hey, I work with Innovative Global and Talents Agency. It's founded by an expert in, you know, O-1 visa law. We just want to have a conversation with you for feedback purposes to get, you know, pushback on our model to see what you think of it. Right. So I'll make like four of these today, along with the one that I sent you. Right. And then I will also give you the link to this list. So this list is where we gather potential clients. Right. That range from Cognizant is a consulting firm that kind of like this already, but this place like LPL Financial. And then there's even like schools. And these places are from like all over. So it might be some from North Carolina. Some might be from Wyoming because I don't know who our target market is going to be. It might be people in bump up, you know, that just don't have access to lawyers anyway. You know, but it might be New York. They're sophisticated and Barclays gets it. They're like, hey, that makes sense. We got money. Let's pay. But it's. diversified and what type of companies are on here, like Ford's on there. And then there's like some schools on there too, like universities. You're assigning us people to contact. Well, you can just go through the, you can go like, it's not like contact this one, contact this one. The thing is, if you do make a contact, just make it, just put on this list. I don't want to contact somebody that they needed to contact the same day. You know what I mean? I know. That's why he just put the name. He just put they've been contacted already. I don't know why she wouldn't put, you know, sometimes they get on my nerves a little bit. Because obviously you would want to know who did the contact. My preference is to be assigned to certain people to contact. Like you contact 1 through 25. You contact... 26 to 35, whatever it is, you know what I mean? That's what I prefer. I don't know. But that's fine. But, you know, Lenita, do you want to be more strategic about it? Or do you want it like that too? Um, it doesn't, whatever works better for, uh, Roland, because it doesn't matter to me if we can just like, if we can put the name beside who's made the contact, then you can see that someone's been contacted, but like, if you forget, just, you know, be like, oh, I made that call and you forget, then it might be like, oh, I'm making a call again. So if you want to just do a sign number, so that way we're not duplicating calls, then we can do that too. I'm okay with that. So, you know, I'm 65, I'm 66 and a half. So this is going to be a shared document that we all work on, right? Is that the deal here? Okay. So look, if you make a contact, if you call them, I can do this, but we're all in Seward. Got it. Okay. Okay. And what happened? Yeah. Yeah. There's four lines, you just put it right there. Okay, okay. And in the text box, you would put, oh, okay, I see contact notes, no answer. Okay, yeah, and then you put whatever the outcome is. Okay, all right. All right, and so there's a couple. So that's my visa jobs. That's something we got from the database of people that are listed as the people that file visas. So they might not be the HR person, might be like a legal person. On ladders, let's see if she tried. Oh, good. So on Ladder, she's actually going and finding jobs that are posted for like, you know, $150,000 and up. And then she goes finds the actual recruiting person to that, right? So for GuideHouse, we know that they have active jobs in these things. And she even has their phone number and stuff. Now, let's see if this smart person, she did it. Oh my gosh, she gets on my nerves. Like, it's like, why wouldn't you have the contact information? I'm going to make her do it. And then also for training purposes, if you could at least make a phone call where you make a couple of phone calls so we can hear. and record please so that we could see just kind of like how you talk through it or if they have a question that maybe we're not able to answer like how you may like answer some questions so it would be helpful to have a video doing it in real time so we can see like what it looks like because reading a script is fine but if I don't see like someone else that's done it and anticipating like questions they may ask that's a good idea all right do any of these look like they are in um california Right now? OK, let me see. Patrick. Checked. Open AI. I want to get it verified with Cloudflare. OK. Are any of these phone numbers on the West Coast? So lazy. 714 oh wow okay so which one was 714 all right so she's head of recruitment for assured partners we're gonna go look them up real quick tell me about So I'm going to look up a couple places. Assured partners. Who was it? Head of HR? Head of recruitment. Tell me about this person. Tell me about if you think they apply for visas. All right, watch this. Why can't I sign it? Boom, boom, boom, Assured Partners. All right, so Assured Partners, CAP, Assured Partners Houston. I'm not sure if that's it. insurance brokerage okay so there's a couple ways to do it I'm just like going through everything to show first I did my research right then I'll go on linkedin if I've helped put innovative global talent you know on your thing or whatever View full profile. More. I'll connect. Add a note. Say, hey, heads up. I have a great candidate for a job posted with your company. We do all the resorts. all right let's pull it up as advertised as wanted I'm surprised that only one of these people is on the west coast it seems strange so is it seven one four seven nine one eight eight eight eight I think it's Venner or Veena. You think her name is Venner or Veena? Probably. I don't know. Where is she from? California. Oh. Well, you could just call her Miss, whatever her last name is. You can ask her, how do you pronounce your first name? Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward. I was just following up on a LinkedIn message I sent you. Just as a background, I'm with Innovative Global Talent Agency. And what's different about us is that we procure visas on the front end for some of the best talent in the world. And we have a former MI6 cybersecurity intelligence officer that is very interested in a job you posted. So I just want to reach out to you, introduce ourselves, introduce the candidate, and also talk about how our model works, since it's a little bit different. But look out for email from us, and you can always give us a call back. Thank you very much. I don't know why she didn't put the... Just make a note. I know, but she's my nurse. Name of contact person. Date of contact. Notes. That's all I need, right? Yes. All right, so then... Where's she at? 714. So Sherrod Seward, today is 8-8-224, left a message and LinkedIn requests with note. So that's it. All right. So what I'll do is a follow up. I'll cut this one off here because my dad's got to go and I want to overload with information. This one's going to really work. We'll give a lot of training. So I'll follow up with the list. I'll follow up one document that's going to have the list. It's got the link, the consultations and the scripts. Chris Alvarez, Then, like a link to like the website, because, like on the website, some of the questions they asked I've already answered I've answered them in facts and there's little videos about it so I'll just point out where that isn't what I'll show you. Chris Alvarez, So. Chris Alvarez, Oh, you know, I took it down that section right here. Chris Alvarez, So in the fact section when you go to these. Chris Alvarez, It has a video that describes. why we're doing everything. These are from questions I've already gotten from employers. What makes us different? Does the job come first? So by going through these, you'll look at and see a lot of the rebuttals that are already on there that they'll ask. OK, I'm going to have to go. All right, that's it. I took too much of your time. I appreciate your efforts. This will be very organized and everybody get paid. So if you bring one subscription, I'll give you two grand per subscription. So if you, that's two grand a month, one subscription. Six subscriptions, that's like, how much is that? Somebody's gonna, that's 12,000 a month. You see? You see? And you wanna go work at Walmart and greet people. And you want to go out and do social work into these defunctional homes. So dysfunctional and they get on my dang on nerves, but I need the money. I do what I gotta do. I know, but this is what we can do. One subscription. It's $2,000 a month. I can do this and that. It's not like... Let's get hyped. Let's go. All right. I'm going to send y'all to recording. Please send the recording and then also send us a recording of you making a live call. And if you could try to, and it may not be possible today because it's getting late and people are not on the West Coast, but if you could try to make a call where you actually make contact and record. So whatever calls you make, just record, please. And then. Yep. I'll make, yeah, I'll make like a couple of calls now and record just to get in the rhythm of it. All right. Thank you. All right. Peace. Bye.",,,,,
Aug.08.2024,Sherrod Sports Visas - Agent Based Petitions in Professional Baseball - Player Cut from Blue Jays,Immigration Sports,Sherrod Sports Visas - Agent Based Petitions in Professional Baseball - Player Cut from Blue Jays,Sherrod Sports Visas - Agent Based Petitions in Professional Baseball - Player Cut from Blue Jays.mp4,Sherrod Sports Visas - Agent Based Petitions in Professional Baseball - Player Cut from Blue Jays.mp3,"How's it going? This is Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visas. And again, I'm discussing the options and flexibility with agent based visa petitions. This time we're talking about Major League Baseball. And there's a lot of foreign players, obviously, in Major League Baseball. But as they get into different type of transactions that take them off their team, their visa problem becomes pretty big. Because once you get released from a team that usually has your P1 visa, you're now kind of out of luck and have to find a way to change status either back to a visitor visa or to a work visa if you have an opportunity to get to one. And usually those options are, like I said, going back to a visitor visa using Form I-539. Or if you have a lot of accolades, you can go for an O-1 visa. and the thing to think about if you get on the o1 visa is if you get signed to a team will they be willing to accept the terms of that o1 visa and let you play on that and it can be structured that that happens the other thing you can do is do a p1 visa if you have a team that's pretty immediately uh available to sign you and support the petition and that team is in a league that makes sense so I'm going to share my screen because we have a situation now where someone has been cut from a major league roster and I believe that they mean they were actually on the team itself that was the major league roster and not one of their minor league affiliates and now they're interested in signing with another team that's in the minor leagues so let's go ahead and look them up now I do not have the player's name in front of me to look to see if they are eligible for O1, but that would be important if they were, because then we don't have to worry about if this particular league supports P1 visas. And there's two ways that a league can support being eligible for P1 visas. One is if they are competing at the, well, the people that compete at it in that league are at the highest level of the sport. or if the league qualifies under the Compete Act as a minor league league, which usually means an affiliation with a major league that they have at least six teams and usually at least $10 million like in revenue. So let's go ahead and look up this league and see what they're about. So let's go see how many teams that they have. One, two, three, four. They definitely have enough teams. league info media guide. Actually, let's go to the about us and see if you can get anything about the affiliation. Okay, so let's go to the end for a second time. The league expanded to suburban Chicago, put the Chicago dogs, a new $60 million facility, Okay. So if people are building these type of stadiums, that should mean that these stadiums are getting the type of revenue that you need for that. So, you know, to get to $10 billion to satisfy the P1 Visa Champions History League directory. What I'd like to know is what is their actual affiliation to the stadium? to the MLB. So it looks like, uh, last year they had prior transfers. So that's good. Let's see about currently in, uh, it'll be, they have a lot of players in the major leagues. Team stats attendance. Let's look at attendance. Yesterday. So they're averaging that much in ticket revenue. Um, so if we do like a calculation, you know, say tickets are 15 bucks. So we have, what about, you know, 5,300 tickets times it's not as much as I thought. Well, the ticket revenue is not going to get us there. Maybe we can just kind of ask them in this league. Cause, um, yeah, maybe you have to go to see if the AI can help us. So what was the name of the league again? I almost forgot American association. to the American Baseball Association, American Association of Baseball. So let's try it like this. Let me go find it in the media guide. American Association, Commissioner, Roster rules. Yeah, we might just have to ask them about the revenue and if they have an official status with Major League Baseball because I see the people going back and forth, but it looks like a little bit hard to ascertain what their revenue is and what's the official affiliation. So this one will need to get more info to do, but that happens. But at least we know. So I will have to reach back out to the prospect and see about getting some more information on this to make sure we have a good good solid case for making the p1 visa in case I get their name and then you know maybe they're good enough for the old one but this kind of highlights what's the problem with um p1 visas and agent-based visas because if they would have done an agent-based visa when they were still on the team the major league team then this might not be an issue they could continue to have that p1 um eligibility even when they were cut with the team so I hope this was helpful but looks like we have more work to do on this one",,x,x,,
Aug.08.2024,Esports Visas - Agent Based Petition Esports,Immigration Non-Sports,Esports Visas - Agent Based Petition Esports,Esports Visas - Agent Based Petition Esports.mp4,Esports Visas - Agent Based Petition Esports.mp3,"Hello, it's me, Sherrod Seward, and I'm discussing esports in a specific situation where someone has played in Rocket League, which is a very popular league, and has switched to Apex, which is a different sport. So every time that you switch a game in esports, it's basically considered a different sport. and depending on that new sport it might not be supportive of doing a p1 based on does the events that the person is going to be participating in qualify as internationally recognized events for people this player has been brought to my attention that they've ranked as high as eighth in the world in this so that makes me very confident that they're good for an o1 visa based on both the competing in the Rocket League and in the new league. When we do it under an O-1 as an esports professional, we can use both of those qualifications for that. And the other reason why I would support an O-1 visa over a P-1 is just because as leagues stop and fold, USCIS is getting more aggressive with revoking P-1s when there's not active competitions going on, or when they think that the competitions that are going on are not to the highest level that would would need a p1 so in this particular circumstance I think the o1 is the better option over the p1 in addition it's been brought to my attention that both teams that the athlete is looking to compete with do not want to serve as sponsor of the visa that is no problem any c corp or llc or even a citizen in the united states can serve as the petitioner for the visa. In this case, we would do it as US agent for multiple employers. We just need a letter of interest from both of those teams, kind of outlaying the basic terms of what they will be doing. And we could also put it into the itinerary that the player will be training for activities when he's not on an organization. So that way, even if he's off an organization, you can still show USCIS that he does have activities to do, and he does not have to be paid by the C-Corp in order to serve as a agent sponsor. So this is pretty good, straightforward. He's great for an O-1, and yes, the agent-based structure would work well, and no, the agent does not have to pay the athlete any money for this visa process. Hope this is helpful and talk to you soon.",,x,x,,
Aug.08.2024,Sherrod meeting Hale - Green Bay Packers issue,Other Video,Sherrod meeting Hale - Green Bay Packers issue,Sherrod meeting Hale - Green Bay Packers issue.mp4,Sherrod meeting Hale - Green Bay Packers issue.mp3,"Hey, Clint. Hello. Can I speak to Mr. Hale or Alex? Yeah. This is Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visa's Gil Law firm. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yep, yep, yep. Well, I want to say congrats to you guys. I heard there's been a signing or there's going to be a signing with the Packers organization. Yeah, already signed on. Already signed. All right. So... Yeah, a couple things to talk to. Like, I've dealt with the Packers before, and it was for another kicker. What have they said so far about the visa situation? They've said they prefer to do it per you are. All right. Okay. Are you talking, like, so when they say them, is it the player's operation person? Or who is it? Yeah, they've got an immigration lawyer. So what they're asking is that if they can speak to you directly so they know where you're up to. Yeah, yeah, I can speak to them. Across the wires, yeah, yeah, yeah. So they'll be finding you yesterday, but they'll find you before today. What's your best contact number? They can call me here. This is the best contact number on this number. Yeah. So what's your thoughts? My thoughts is it's best if they would let you go with the 0-1 because here's what happens is two things with the P1 when you're talking about NFL teams. It's like even when you get on the team, you know, they don't have the 52-man roster yet. So they're still at the 90-man roster. Yeah. Right, so that P1 is for them, and then just being realistic about it, there's a chance that you don't make the roster, and so they take it away. Now, what we could do is if that happens, they could let me know. If they let us know, then we can just hold the O1 and file it then. I was thinking that might be the best way to do it because they really like Alex. Okay. He's kicking it. Yeah, he was. I remember. All right. So, here's the thing. So, so I was like, you know, if, so if worst case scenario, they do the P1 and he does get cut, would he get a grace period of 30 days to switch to another status? It'd be better if they would just tell us, you know, that was getting ready to happen and give a grace period. So we don't have to worry about it. We could just have the visa ready and the next day we can send it. And, but one, one thing is good is like, I'll talk to them because sometimes it's football is not very progressive when it comes to like immigration stuff. But I might be able to use this as an opportunity to educate them again, because if they still have the same immigration attorney they did like three years ago, this person only probably does three visas in sports per year. You know, even though they might do a whole bunch of H-1B. So I could talk to them because I'm like, hey, this is going to come up a lot and it's going to help you keep players available for yourself and the league in general. So like maybe I can use this opportunity because another thing that comes up is getting a letter from the Players Association. So I could use it as an opportunity to try to get them so we can call the Players Association, have this consultation letter ready to go. Yes. So you want to play it like we'll let him do the P1 and just say... Gotcha. Okay, that'll work. And here's another thing I wanted to bring up to you when I had you on the phone is you have your own business, right? That's... Is it domiciled in the U.S. or is it domiciled somewhere else? We're retired. We're in strike. I know you're retired, but is the LLC or the corporation still open? All right. Because one thing I was going to suggest is that we've seen that's been helpful, especially like with some of the athlete things is we'll label it as we're a U.S. agent. So I'm talking about the talent agency, U.S. agent for like foreign employer. And it just helps us get it, get more consistent on the results. So like we'll basically say we're a U.S. agent for the name of your business. And then we'll say like when he's not playing for a team, he's responsible for staying ready for the next opportunity. And then it just helps us out. So what's the name of that business? So I can tell Wayne when he writes it. Yeah, yeah. That's Hailstorm Propaganda. Oh. Can you spell that? Yeah. Hailstorm. H-A-L-E. Yep. Okay. S-T-O-R-M. Uh-huh. Propaganda. P-T-Y-L-T-D. Okay. Got you. All right. I got you. All right, so we'll use that. I'll talk to them, like stay, you know, not freak them out. Just tell them to do the P1. And then we'll have it ready to go for when, well, hopefully not, because hopefully we'll be on the 52 roster. But as soon as anything happens, we'll be ready to put that O1 in. Oh, that'd be good. So where are we up to with the O1? Oh, everything's ready. We just had to get the structure. And you know what? The signing actually helps bring it to like it's really, really good argument. Because when you're on NFL roster, you're automatically one of the best kickers in the world. Right. So that's it. That's it. Exactly. So a copy or proof of that signing would be great. So we can just tap that off with the that. And I spoke to you about the foreign employer thing. And so we'll be ready to go. Just be ready. Yeah. I just wrote to. Yep. I got to look at it myself. It's, hold on. No, it's 956. Hold on one sec. All right. 956-224-9372. call they can give you calls like this morning yep I'll be at the phone I'm working today I'm here yeah all right that's wonderful thanks very much no problem thank you for the call back",,,,,
Aug.08.2024,IGTA next pitchdeck - Franz,Training Video,IGTA next pitchdeck - Franz,IGTA next pitchdeck - Franz.mp4,IGTA next pitchdeck - Franz.mp3,"All right, Franz, we're going to try to run through this quick, but we need to make pitch deck three or four point or whatever it is. We need a new pitch deck, but we're going to use a lot of the same information. The latest version was too short. So we're going to make more and I'm going to kind of walk you through that. All right, so the first slide, obviously good. This one, I'm putting some new language in that goes here, but the rest can stay the same. So this is just going to kind of change. This one will be the same. After this will be one that says market, it'll be one that kind of says market opportunity. So the market opportunity, pay attention, is this one. So the market opportunity will have this slide, like, well, this image. So I'll write it out. So I'll say market opportunity. On the top. Matter of fact, I'll start writing this so you can see it. Ooh, they won't play on Saturday, child. That ain't happening. So market opportunity. That's what it'll say across the top. On the right-hand side, it should say this. It should say, um, So they say, forty-five point two billion market. And then have the graphic about the visas, this. I want this, so it'll say forty-two point five billion dollar market. So you can keep this one here, but we're going to get rid of these two. So instead of those two being there, I'm going to say, okay, so I'm going to do like with ten placements per month. Do five executives. Let me get a calculator together. So, thirty thousand times five is one fifty. I'm just doing math, Franz. Bear with me. Thirty thousand times five equals one hundred fifty thousand. One fifty K. Then. Two hundred seventy thousand times. Three times five. Then say we have five employers, seven employers. That's seventy three. Seventy grand. So what's that? That's one for the plus seventy six hundred fifty thousand. Six places a month with. This is so much money. So that's point one that I want. So this point that I just wrote, this one, I want it, where's that? So instead of this, so it'd be right here. That would be right here. And then, it's a little complicated. Let's see revenue. About seven minutes. Four. What? Placement of five. so Dan, he's made twenty million in poker. This guy that we have a pipeline with might have won twenty million dollars in poker. Yeah, it's for Franz. Okay, so Franz, we're getting rid of this. While our process is better, we're going to keep that in there. We get rid of this. Keep this, so put this business model one in there. Put the business model slide back in. That's slide eight. Okay. So if I don't mention putting something in, just like keep it the same as it is. But make sure the numbers are changed so that it flows right. Trade for news. I need that market strategy. We're not doing that. Okay, put the revenue forecast in. So this slide is revenue forecast and put it in. Put a success story in. The Shabam thing. Get rid of S, like, okay, get rid of all that. And then close it out. So then close it out. And our job is done here. All right. So Franz, let's recap real quick. So we're looking at it like we're just fixing this one. Slide one is great. Update the date here. Executive summary. Put this writing in there. This would be a sixty seven million dollar. OK, so the market is the hardest part. The market opportunity. Slide three. What I want you to do. Well. Keep this in here. Why our process is better. Okay, so in between these two is where you put the market opportunity slide, which will be, you'll take, you'll take this graphic, above it put, forty-five point two billion dollar industry in U.S. You will keep this one. Now these two will be replaced by these two. Make it look nice and, you know, get the punctuation correct. So then this will be here. And then before we get to this one, there's two slides that need to go in. Business model. and revenue forecast case study. So put those three in there, make sure that the page numbers are right, and then we're good to go. All right, buddy, you are appreciated.",,,,,

I'm not sure what it was. All right. So here, we're going to start by looking at keywords that we like. I'm going to put them in the notes for you. All right. Looking for data science, military, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence. Okay. So one is we'll put in data science. Data science, and then we search. Now we look at these. So one is we're going to look at more. We're going to make sure the conversation is up to one hundred fifty thousand. Right. So remote, we're getting rid of remote, so let's be hybrid or in-person. This one we're not concerned with. Data engineer, so all these data engineers. are great. But we're looking for the higher paying jobs. So ones that go like hundred and eight, maybe not for us. But we don't want a pharmacist, right? But we don't want one that is like you have to be a doctor. The best ones are ones that are not general, but this one looks good too. How many jobs is saying that we have? Data science. So there's a lot of these jobs. So one thing that can be done is like when you put it down like this, and we get rid of like education, pharmaceuticals. So let's look at business services and information technology. Enterprise, aerospace and defense. Technical services. All right. So I did it like that so we don't have all the healthcare people. Um, so maybe just get a couple from the healthcare people and then look under here. So you can see these, but these are the ones that we want to grab. This one's a little bit low. This one's a good, a good one. All right. So this one's not a United States. So you want to make sure that any United States counties. So that, yeah, that one was in the United States, I mean, in Canada. So we definitely want to find ones that are in the United States, like look at this one. Public trust. Use some metadata, terminologies. Right. So one thing that's best for us is if we can get information on who's the person that's actually putting this out. So let's see if we click this, what do we get? Client house, total value of jobs, have a lot of jobs. All right. So we don't see that people. So what you would do maybe is go to guide house, go to LinkedIn. And you can see jobs. Let's go to jobs. International injury providers. All right, so you can look at people. Because That recruiter, see if something comes up. So senior cyber recruiter. Make sure that she actually like works there still. So she's at Greenhouse. So she's a good one. So we definitely want to connect with her. And that'd be the type of people that you want to put on the list. Okay, but that's how we do it. We want to get to actual people, not just the standard name that's on there. So now let's look at another one. So that was data science. Now we can look at cyber security. for our PhD and related field, you know, in machine learning. So that's the type of job we like, payment integrity consultant. But like, we'll just look at this and see, oh, we already looked at that. Accenture, so we can open this link in a new tab. Let's see if they have the person upload your professional contacts. I'll be sure to load up professional contacts. Go to LinkedIn account settings. I can do that later. to see who we know that's with it. But again, in this job, it doesn't look like they have the person listed there that would do this. But you can see this job is in Arlington, right? So we can go to LinkedIn, go to Accenture. A lot of followers, it's a huge company. So then you go to people or when it could go to jobs again, see, see all jobs book, like they're not in the United States. So let's go back, go to people. We put recruiting. And then where they studied. I'm gonna go to United States. Arlington. Arlington, Virginia. and see who comes there recruiting associate sourcing global recruiting sourcing lead talent so like this would be a person we want that's your dc our technology recruiting specialist that with them yeah that's how we do that and so then you could also go to ladders and put um artificial intelligence so here there's only that meets those jobs so I feel like all these should get be able to get on there so even if you just do the artificial intelligence people like for now that'd be fine you know if we did military well the military is fine so just focus on AI in the artificial intelligence job. Matter of fact, let's see how many of these that it shows. And remember to skip ones that have, they're about a doctor. So we don't want veterinarian. We don't want physicians or pharmacy. That one could be fine. But we want to avoid the ones that say they need doctors. All right, so that's how you use Ladder. So just focus on that one for tomorrow and continue to get us contacts on the list. All right, thank you very much. Your staff knows how to do that. How to do that. I figured. All right. The project is not happening. But you should. Law firm. In my opinion. That is probably. Oh. Good. But if I. um",,,,,

Previous to that, I was an immigration attorney where I focused on O-one and P-one visa solutions for some of the largest sports organizations in the United States. Using the unique structure of U.S. Agent in these P-one and O-one categories, we moved from doing visas for people on the field all the way to the executive suites. Using these same methods, we are now doing this talent agency where we involve the same visa process that we did in sports to other industries in the mainstream. And what it does is allow employers to stay completely out of the visa process while enjoying some of the best talent there is in the world. In this case, we're approaching you with one of our defense talent candidates who was at the highest level of military operations in the field in their home country of Britain and now currently in the United States doing some work to do some basically consulting here with the defense ministry here in the United States. but they are looking to go private, have a top secret clearance, and they're pretty indicative of the type of talent we keep in our pipeline. So I just want to introduce myself, Sherrod Seward, and I'd like to introduce this candidate in our unique process that we bring this world-class talent to you in the very new future. So I look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great day.",,,,,
Aug.06.2024,amirhossein shaker,Client Correspondence,amirhossein shaker,amirhossein shaker.mp4,amirhossein shaker.mp3,"Hello, this is Sherrod Seward, immigration attorney with Gill Law Firm, Sherrod Sports Visas. I was responding to your inquiry for an EB-I-A. I went ahead and looked you up. One, congratulations on your great career. I can see that you've had a lot of great championships, Olympian Asian World Cup. All very impressive. So I think we can go ahead and confirm that you are a great candidate for the EB-A. The way it would work is we would file here for it. And once approved, you would need to do a consulate interview. Right now, there's not one in Iran, so you have to travel to maybe Turkey or something like that to go ahead and get that visa applied once the EB-A is done. But yeah, we can apply for the EB-A on regular processing, which usually takes about eight months to twelve months, or we can use premium processing. We'll get you decisions and at least responses in fifteen business days or less. And then from there, once you're approved, we can go move to scheduling an interview when the visa is available for you in a place that makes sense to go ahead and get the permanent residence. But I'm going to have the team send this email to you with this video, and we look forward to getting started with you. Thank you very much and congratulations on being selected as a great candidate for EB-A.",,,,,

I was giving you this video to explain how it works with the consultant basis. So what we're doing here is instead of doing the visa with the law firm, we're doing a visa on a consultant basis through the talent agency. where we'll get the visa and then we'll also use the talent agency to help maybe find some jobs, whether it be maybe a cricket team or a cricket school, stuff like that. But you're also free to go find your own opportunities as well. But it's one of those things that's very helpful for both the talent agency and for you as the client of this to do it. And since it's not done through the law firm, it does have the opportunity to have the discounted fees. We only do this a certain type of years for clients that we kind of really believe in. We like your background. We like your national team experience. So we're willing to work with you on this basis. But it's kind of first come, first serve. So that's why you'd have to take advantage of it pretty much right away. So otherwise, we'd probably move on to a different candidate as we don't do this a lot. But that's how it works. We will file a one visa on behalf of Innovative Global Talent Agency for your behalf. It will last for three years and we will also look to inquire to see if we can find jobs and skills that fit your skill set. But you're also free to go find your own and you can work on these different jobs on the same visa. Hope this clears everything up and just execute the payment if you'd like to get started. Like I said, this is something we need to do pretty quickly. Thank you very much.",,,,,

This is Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visa's Gill Law Firm. I was calling to follow up on a message I left on your phone. We did get your inquiry that you're interested in a P-one visa. I looked up your profile on Word Athletics. Everything looks great. I think that you could even go after an O-one visa if you wanted to do more than just compete in the United States. You could use that to do coaching seminars and just as a more wider work authorization. One detail I wanted to talk about was, do you have a petitioner that would be a citizen or an entity, a company in the United States to serve as your petitioner, the one that signs off on the paperwork? If you do not have one of those, that's no problem. We can do that on your behalf. through Innovative Global Talent Agency. There is a two thousand dollar fee for that that lasts for three years and they will serve as the petitioner for your paperwork and it won't interfere with your affairs. You'll be able to do everything that you need to do with that without them interfering too much. So I just wanted to let you know that we will have the team send over the details for the P-One visa, the details of the petitioner service, and we look forward to working with you. Have a great day.",,,,,

We're pleased to get your request for an EB-A. I went and looked at your profile and saw that you are a national team coach for Oman and you had a great career yourself when it came to playing cricket. But I just wanted to go ahead and confirm that we think you're a great candidate for the EB-A. The way the fees break down there is I'm assuming that you're in the United States, but in case you're not, you can do consular processing. So the first part is the EB-A. The filing fee there is I think it's ten one thousand fifteen. But you can add premium processing if you're looking to get a quick turnaround on a decision there. And the legal fee for that is ten thousand flat fee. And that'll take you. everything you need for the EB-A. Now the next portion is, do you want to go for the green card right away? So you can, if you're in the United States, you can apply for the adjustment of status to get the green card at the same time as the EB-A. If you're doing it while in the United States, you'll need to stay here for eight months to wait for the advanced parole to kick in. And that will allow you to travel back and forth while you're waiting. If you do leave before that happens, then you would be abandoning the adjustment part of the application. That process is five thousand plus the filing fees, which will be in the link that we send to you. And then if you're not in the United States, you want to do consular processing, then that would be four thousand. And we would wait for an interview to be available for you where you are. And then you would interview for the green card and we would prepare the package for you there once you're approved. So those are your options. Congratulations on being selected as a great candidate for the EB-A and the team will send you everything you need. to get started. Thank you very much.",,,,,

I just gave you a call to confirm your P one a visa. I did get a chance to look at your background and I see your rankings and your best live cash. Forty one thousand. Not bad. And you're twelve thousand all time money lists. You also have a very high ranking for Australia all time under four hundred. So that's pretty good. We have done P-A visas with persons that have less accolades than you do in poker. So we're ready to go. Let me give you a couple of details, though. One is if you do not have a petitioner, we do have a service that can serve as your petitioner. That's two thousand and it lasts for three years. Innovative Global Talent Agency. I see that you're currently in the United States on an ESTA visa waiver, which means once your visa is approved to take advantage of it, you will need to go to a consulate. It doesn't have to be in Australia. I would probably say the best place to go is Canada to get a quick interview to get the visa applied to your passport because ESTA is a waiver of a visa. So we can't change from ESTA to a P-I. You would need to go to the consulate and get it done. uh but yes I was just calling to send this video to confirm that you're a great candidate for p-one-a if you do need a petitioner we do have that service available for you and that you will need to do a consulate interview when your visa is approved to get it applied to your passport thanks for calling us and we look forward to hearing back from you thank you very much",,,,,

I want to just appreciate and congratulate you on the job that you're doing. What I need you to know is I think you know from last time that your appropriate place for you to send your invoice is Andre. That's who handles your particular invoice. So please remember that in the future and roll with that. That being said, there's a couple of things I want to get into for this training. One is let me present this. I want you to start. suppliers with pricing quote but we did get a quote okay so here on the suppliers or pricing I just want you to make a supplier in general thing. So even if we don't have a quote, go ahead and put the suppliers that we start the process with with getting teamed up. To be very clear, with all the suppliers that you're hitting up for widgets, even if we don't get the bid, I want it so that we have a, what do you call it? Not a contract, but I want us to be able to sell their products. So whatever they call it for us to be set up as a vendor, I expect that to be done for all the suppliers that we're working on. And I want them listed here. Now I want another tab. I want you to make another tab that's called. So contract. Partners. So this one is going to be for what I'm going to teach now is how to find the vendors that have won contracts for things similar to what we're selling. So number one, I want you to go and keep putting in suppliers, getting set up as vendor with contracts and have them listed here. Let's see. Password. Website. Product description. Tell me what type of products they have. So I'll let you clean that up. Then here I want the contractors. I'll let you kind of decide originally what information is valuable to know because you're going to be the one actually doing it. So let's see how this works. Sorry for the sound. I've got a new contract. It's nice that you're doing that, OK? Alright. So let's say we have. This for plastic sheeting. I'll go to sam.gov. In the search. We'll put. Any words? Plastic sheeting. Notice type award notice. So let's make sure that we have award notice. And look and see if there's anything closest, close to like what we've been doing. So right here, there's like 11,000 awards, plastic sheeting. So if it's too much, like there's just too many, Too many things that come up. I just put this. And if nothing comes up under award notice, get rid of award notice. Let's see. Contract opportunities, search editor. Alright, so it looks like you can't look it up by notice. Maybe plastic shading is too much, but let's try this. And for a lot of them, maybe nothing comes up and that's fine. And we want any words. To come up. Alright, so veterans affair award notice and Mary Tech can contract and contracting. So now. Let me see how many others there's 500, 5,000. So maybe just get the best ones, but the one is we want somebody that's not a set aside. So look at the, um, look at that $4 million original set aside. So we don't want this because they're set aside. So they have the same thing as we do. Right, so we want to find some that do not have set asides. So we don't want that one because it was only set aside for Veterans of Affairs. So look, this one's Department of Agriculture. Now what's the original bid for? The original bid was for healthcare stuff. So it's not already in, it's not great because it's for sewage and sewage pump and motor requests. Not necessarily like what we want, but we want ones that are one that are not with the veterans service engine or container. So maybe we have to just search better. We'll go to all words and we'll say this. We'll say barrier healthcare. Right? Awarded barrier healthcare. So if we go here, it looks like they won the award themselves with Bayer. So by going into here, we might be able to get the contact to Bayer. So they won a $33,000 contract for repairing. They're in Dayton, Ohio. So let's see what's in here. So that doesn't give us the thing that we need, but we do know that it was Bayer itself that was the contract thing, so. Sole source procurement. Let's see if we can find somebody that's not actually Bayer. Okay, so we need a notice type. We need to put award again. So you can see that the only one contract on here was like Bayer. So maybe this wasn't a good one. But let's see if we can at least find the contact information of person so that one didn't quite work out and that's fine we'll just go back let's go search again for another type of bid to see if something comes up transport utility carts so let's put transport utility carts No matches found. So let's put exact phrase, no matches found. Now the ND words. General contracting. Two storage containers. So it looks like we're striking out so far. Let's go to the next one. Try Phoenix Snowden. Oh, we can put inactive too. Oh, so maybe, okay, that's what we need to put. We need to not put active, but inactive as well. So let's try all words, which, um, Transport utility carts. Nice. So we might have something here. Earth smart. So see how these were Veterans Affairs? We want the ones that are not with Veterans Affairs. So in this case, we go here. Award notice. Right, and you would go find these people. So let's go to our chat. Success story. A particular vendor. All right. So then I want you to take this information. Oops. Say a name. All right. Info it. Now we have a template. And we're going to send them this message that, you know, you're going to put in everything else that, you know, we need to put in. So where's the bid that they want? And then you can send it. And I want their information put in here. So like you put the name, date, contract that we saw, link, link to their website. And what's also helpful is this. Complete contracts, show more. Put their completed contracts. So we want their contracts and we want their specialties and things of that nature to verify veteran disabled disowned. So they are a competitor of ours. So that's not great since they're that we want ones that aren't certified veteran disabled. Um, but we can say we're a minority too. So we do that as well. And then, um, there was another one. hashes, waste, maneuverable, earth smart. So really you can get trade and allowance. Make sure it's something similar to what we do. Synopsis, distracted driver programming. That's not what we want. This one's with the veteran affair. So it's probably a set aside. Let's see if it is. See, original set aside. So we don't want that one. So now that you know how to get the information, what I'm going to do now is just kind of quickly go through and find good opportunities that look like they're on there. So let's look at this one. So remember, we need inactive, inactive, award notice, and then try all words first. So this one has everything. So then let's go again and just put VPS. This one's like an art. So all of these are with Veterans Affairs. Look to see if there's one that's not with Veterans Affairs. Looks like they all are. So I imagine if you go to it. Oh, sorry. If you go to the bid under Veterans Affairs are probably all set asides. Total small business. So this one's actually not a set aside. It's a small business set aside. And the contractors from Pennsylvania. But we're not going to have like Cause that's transport. We're looking for people that are selling tangible things. Employee shuttle service. It's all in Pittsburgh. Burial services, nitrate gloves. So let's look at this. Let's see if it's a set aside. So it's not a set aside. So this is the type of person that we want. So I'm going to grab this and kind of put it here. All right. So let's go to a different type of bid. Plastic sheeting is a little trend. It's a little generic. So like who even knows probably how much this stuff will go in. So let's see who has Phoenix Snowden. bids that they want. So I'm going to go to exact phrase, get rid of this. Nothing's under Phoenix Snowden. I'll try to get rid of this hyphen. Nothing's there. Okay, that's fine. Surge protectors. So that's almost right, exact phrase for surge protectors. Metal grade surge protectors. So this one's not, let's see how many we have. We have 22 results. So this is a good one. So there's ones in here that aren't with the Veterans Affairs. So we're going to look at those. And it's pretty recent. Who's the awardee? So here's the awardee, $18,000. So I'm going to put them here so you can kind of see it, and then you would go and get the information about them. But in here, there's like a couple of them that look pretty good. Standing quote, MMG Technology Group. So let's go into it a little bit further, what we're looking at, because we want to make sure they're not veteran disabled too. That would be ideal. So when you do it, always go here. Let's look at it. Right, so that one, they look like they're not good there. I mean, they are good. They're not set aside. So we like that. I put them on there. So that's one thing that I need to be on the trade. We need to have the set aside. So we need on the sheet, NASIX codes, HEC. So we'll need that on this sheet. So when you go to this tab here, we'll need to know how they're set aside along with their NASIX codes I said earlier. All right, so cool. They don't see any set asides that we have. So we like that. If I put them on the sheet. surge protector and like these are kind of getting old so you know you could probably start at um you know 2019 is fine five years ago whatever we don't need to get into these ones that are that old so let's go back to our sheet where we at right there with it dental chair accessories power evacuation stair chairs Get out of here. Let's go. No matches. So you can go. Try that. And try this. Nothing right, so that one is probably we could leave alone. Grassy Quantico and see grassy. I don't think this is really particularly good one. But let's try it. Rid of all that. Grassy. Never even grassy OK. Let's go to microscope. One of these bids already passed. So one thing I want you to do is once you do like, first of all, start with the new ones. We're going to start with the new ones and go back. So these old ones, yeah, let's just forget that. Because what I want you to do is get the previous winners and like start the contract thing and then get these old ones off the list. Construction edition for middle, okay, staffing service. Imagine if you put it. So if a staffing service. Oh, sorry. You're probably going to get a whole bunch. Like, let's see if I could get thousands. Actually, we've only got 1,000. Renovate, specialty pharmacy renovation. Indian Health. See this DAX staffing and solutions? Go ahead and get them. It looks like they're, let's see what type of set-aside they have. It's Sunrise Beach, Missouri. Let's look them up, see what their set-aside is. Okay, that's what set asides do they have. Oh, they're just disabled, but they're not minority. So put them in there. Want them for myself. So I put them in the meeting me. Alright, so get them. For staffing, don't worry about this too much. I'm just going to grab a couple. Here that look. Good to me. But in general, don't worry about the staffing Azure 06. This is an office of staffing. See, this one wasn't a set aside. So go ahead and add them up to. I think the staffing might be good for us. Agile 6 is winning a lot of this. Tribal Health. Indian Health Service. Contractor, $5 million. But actually, it looks like I shouldn't have said no to staffing. Staffing might be good for us because a lot of these people have good contracts and they're not set aside already. And we do have some value we can add to them with on the immigration side. All right, so put them on the list. I draw six tribal health category. Our investigations and staffing. This is a little contract. Everyone thing to do with that. Prayer. Prime Physicians, PLLC. So this looks like physicians. Whoa, this one's for $100 million. $200 million. Let them up and try to find some actual contacts here. So yeah, look them up and try to find some actual time, like call them, see if we can get somebody. Let's look up a couple more. See this there's tribal health again, AB staffing solutions. So this one might be a set AB staffing solutions. This is, this must be a sole source. Temporary health services four hundred million dollars Put that in mine travel nurses oh I love it yeah look them up too all right let's get this is crazy let me try to get um five more of this and then we'll look at something else Agile six, tribal health, primary physicians, we already saw that. Worldwide medical staffing, Bay Area anesthesia, dental service, nurse practitioner services, Multiple awards schedule, higher connections. Oops. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to open up a couple of new tabs. There's a lot of nursing staffing. Colonial federal healthcare. Staffing models, we all need RNs. Understaffing. And staffing is where it's at. Two general surgeons. Maxim healthcare staffing services. If you can get in like healthcare people, this would be great. A lot of this is in staffing, so let's try to find something else. All staffing, nursing, nursing. A lot of nursing. Let's take one more. Nursing, because it looks like it's a different person that did it. Heroes for hire. Heroes hire, so that's definitely veterans. Adept professional staffing. Alright, let's go look through these. Higher connections $1,000,000. So I'll put these on the test sheet and I'll let you go through and see what's up with all these guys. $14 million. But go ahead and look for the widgets once too. Don't forget about the widgets. This staffing is a special project. So in the future, don't do it for the staffing. I just want to get the contact information to these people and I want you to send the message to them. But really, we're looking for widgets, like tangible items things. I'll do another training tomorrow on this. But do what you can. $51 million. You got to do what you can with this. And start those two tabs that I was talking about. We'll start one new tab and make one tab better. Starting with the newer contracts and moving back, don't start with the old contracts and move forward. Start with the ones that are hot opportunities and move backwards. 500,000. We don't care about this little $10,000 one. All right. So that's the one with staffing. I'll probably do another one soon.

And we're looking to reach out to clients to get feedback for free question asking and the discount if they want to do a visa within the next two months. Now, I have this list here. where you'll see, so I want you to start from the back. I want you to start here, especially with the ones that have an X that are highlighted. And for all the ones that have an X, well, for here, while there's highlights, just do the ones that are highlighted. But you're going to get to a point to where the highlights stop. So when the highlights stop, let's find out where that is, at row sixty, I want you to just keep going with the ones that have an X. Um, do the ones up to line sixty and then, like, every day, just try to get, um, thirty or so of these per day in the morning before we get to the stuff. All right.

We went and did a preliminary evaluation of your skill set and thought that the P-A would be advantageous. But looking more at how you've been a coach and been contributing to the overall health and wellness of squash in Pakistan, it's more than a player. We think that the O-A would actually be the most appropriate visa in your circumstance. that's because the p-one visa is just for competing but with the o-one you can make the same type of contributions in the united states whether it be coaching doing seminars making content there's a lot more work authorization that comes with that and it's also a great way to segue into a self-sponsored green card for permanent residents so I'm going to have the team adjust the message that we sent to you and have you confirm for the O one a. So please get back with the team with your thoughts on it. You always have the option of scheduling a formal consultation if you want to invest in more details of the program. Thank you very much.",,x,x,,

And it was a great inquiry. Looking at the background, they do have several wins in country that do have press coverage in Ghana and perhaps in some neighboring countries. What they do not have, it looks like, is a high international ranking in the PGA tournament. Well, the PGA rankings. And what we want to say is even if you do not have high international rankings in the PGA, it does not preclude someone from getting a P-one visa as an internationally recognized athlete. What we like to see are other things such as do they have, one, strong experts in country to show that they're good in their region, internationally recognized in their region. Second, we look to see if they have an association with a national association in that country. And we saw that they did have the kind of send off from the Board of Golfing in Ghana. Third, we look to see if there's experts that can attest to how good their international presence is, not only in country, but in the rankings. And then also we can look at awards. So even if you haven't won major tournaments in the world, if you have won national tournaments in your country and the coverage of that, when it does spread to one experts that are outside of country or even media publishing that's outside of your country that's enough to be good enough for the p-one visa in this case we are going to go ahead and say that we are confident and confirm eligibility for the p-one for this golfer so hopefully we look forward to working with them in the near future thank you very much",,x,x,,
"July.31,2024",Sherrod Seward consideres ESTA inquiry from Professional Poker Player,Immigration Sports,Sherrod Seward consideres ESTA inquiry from Professional Poker Player, Sherrod Seward consideres ESTA inquiry from Professional Poker Player.mp4,Sherrod Seward consideres ESTA inquiry from Professional Poker Player.mp3,"Hello, this is attorney Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visas responding to an inquiry that we got for a professional poker player with something that comes up quite a bit. And that is traveling on ESTA and visitor visas versus getting a work visa to come to the United States to play in the poker tournaments. What has happened? as we understand it, is this person has been traveling to the United States maybe four to six times per year to compete in poker tournaments where they are paid and do report those earnings on ITIN. Unfortunately, on the last trip to the United States, they were brought into secondary inspection at the port of entry and asked about their activities. and they want to know if they can continue doing these activities on ESTA, or is it best to switch to another type of visa? What I'd say is this. Important to remember that ESTA visa waivers are kind of a privileged thing and not a right. So there's not a lot of teeth that one has to combat that once they have been flagged by the CPD consular officers and border protection officers. Because while there are rules associated with ESTA, they always have the discretion to pull those away. So what we say is for poker players is that once you're flagged, the best thing to do is go ahead to switch to the P1 visa. It's something that's going to last for a while. We usually do them for three years for the first one. And there's just a lot more safety knowing that you'll get through CPV every time. And then you can also start to do other things such as accept sponsorship money, do ancillary things such as sponsorship activations, maybe even seminars here and there. to make it worth it to do that. And also, you can stay much longer in the United States and even get P4 visas for your spouse if you have one in children under the age of 21. But ultimately, the consular, the border control officers do have complete discretion when it comes to those ESTA visa waivers. So they don't really have to have a big reason to go ahead and pull those. And once you're flagged, that's kind of in the system once you've been to secondary. So in this case, I looked the person up. They were ranked as high as 170th in their country, 8,000 on the money list. And that's perfect, perfect way to go get the P1 visa. We've done visas for people that have been ranked there before. And the winnings look as high as what we've seen before and what we've done the visa. So I'd highly suggest going to the P1 visa to get that safety, knowing that you'll get through CPV. Your background looks very good as far as being eligible. And save yourself the headache. Consider the P1. Thank you very much.",,x,x,,

And Franz, yours might change from what we're doing if something comes to mind. But everybody's doing a great job. Let's continue what we're doing. And remember the ultimate goal that we're doing here is trying to get subscribed folks. We need more subscriptions from the employers. So if you have any questions, put that into the box. If you have some ideas of how we can get these subscriptions to respond to this email with it. One thing I'm looking for help on is what would be the best way to keep track of the leads that are going on? We can either try to do it in Dubsado or we can even try to do it in... and Asana.

This is Sherrod Seward, and I'm doing this video just to do a quick demo to see the power of this tool, LegalBridge, which I think is awesome for O-one visas, but apparently they do a lot more. But I'm just going to do a quick application for Canelo Alvarez just to show real quick how powerful this tool is. So Let's get into it. So the first part is like an evaluation. Come here and select documents. And it's going to give an evaluation based on the documents that you put in. All right, so we've got those all loaded up. Rename the documents for you. We upload them into the evaluator. What this part does is it tells you, based on the information presented, how likely they are for that visa category. If I wanted to, I could have put in the notes, the notes there to give it more context. But this time, I'm just going to let the documents speak for themselves. And after a little bit, it is going to give us the results. What I will do is I'll start pausing it while it's kind of waiting. It usually doesn't take that long, but for the sake of the length of the video. I'll do it. So we're back. Took about sixty seconds to do the evaluation. Now notice right here. This is what it gets out, says information lacks sufficient detail. Now, mind you that I didn't put all that information in for context, but it could see that he has multiple awards. They have that listed. And for each category. they'll make suggestions on how the evidence you submitted will fit into this, which is great. And then you can make private notes here, which will be visible to you about the evidence. Say like, hey, there needs to be more context to fully show why the championships are needed, and also need media reports for remuneration. Okay. So now we'll go to the petition information. Petitioner, we'll put innovative global talent agency for sake of that. Field endeavor is close US position. I put world-class boxer. But see, they give you stuff here. So I'm gonna put boxing and related activities. Save it, and I'm going to the next one. All right, so here we're in the playground. This is where we can put even more documents that are not here. But for each document that's listed, we can put the activities or the criteria that we think it satisfies. So as IVF article, I can say that's recognized prize and awards. I can put it in for published material. I could put it for employment in critical capacity. and I can tag it for certain things to the IBF title, Nell Alvarez. Save it. His biography, again, they already have theirs that are there. Let's go ahead and click those. Because I'm kind of just going through it. and so on and so on. So for whatever evidence paper that you have, you can go ahead and assign it to the criteria that you're doing. So it'll let you know at the bottom what criteria categories you've already established and all tagged documents. And you can even add more, more as well. So this is where you're kind of playing around with the evidence that you submitted. You can even upload more documents, things of that nature. Great, now we're gonna move on to the next, to re-get into actually building up more documents. So if you need a resume, you can put a resume there, and it checks which ones that you have put evidence for and which not. There's immigration documents, this is where you can put the passport, personal documents like the I-Ninety-Four, company documents. So I can go to a very global talent agency, I'll save the PDF. Then go ahead and upload this. Oh, sorry. So when you upload documents, you can put what criteria it's for at this point when you're in this part of the application, which is the studio in this one. So this one I'm putting company documents. Upload. Followed successfully, so it's there. Now, here's a great feature that I think is awesome. So say I'm right here, right? And we have the published material about this. We can go to generate a letter of recommendation. I will say we're doing it for an advisory opinion or whatever it should be. Name of the recommender. We can say president. We can say, I know the guy's name. I'm not going to put it. Someone put John Doe. I'm going to put his real name. You can say president. of the WBC. You can even put a LinkedIn profile here. So maybe I'll use my own. Sorry. Then you can put email. We're going to skip that. Details. Now we can put PDFs about it. The other documents about the person. Alright, I thought there was a. And here's we can provide additional information, say. That this is for one visa and his status. As a champion. And ours and other organizations make him one of the best boxers of all time. Oh, recommender name. Sorry. So I've got a little bit more work to do. User error. I'll try to do it again right here. So do advisory opinion. Do Sherrod Seward, president of WBC. Can add that. Don't need to add that. Document inventory additional details. We'll put the same thing. Say that he is one of the best boxers of all time. I believe this should generate. Looks like I'm doing something wrong here. So it looks like you do have to put a document of the person. So there's a little glitch there. It's working so well. I'm just putting stuff in here just to get it going. Documents of the recommender. I said that'll work out. So maybe it's the case that you do have to I have to try that later.",,x,,,

How's it going? I have a new reach out thing that I want to do and show you so that we can reach out to contacts that we already have before. And it's just about making a LinkedIn connection and sending them to them. So I'm going to do some right now with this I made on ChatGPT. But you can make a similar one to send to other contacts. But I'm just going to show you how it works. So one is whoever's doing this will need to have a LinkedIn profile that has Innovative Global Talent Agency in their profiles where they work at as a recruitment specialist or account specialist, stuff like that. And so all we do is this. We keep that there. We're going down our contact list to find people that we're looking for. Right now I'm doing something where I have a candidate and I want to let these people know about. So. L. Harris Technologies. And you don't want to do this more than about thirty times for connections per day. So I'm about to do maybe ten right now. HR people. Experience. So you go to connect and you go to connect with note. And then all you need to do is copy. Put that there. send so your note will be different but the thing is since you have the innovative global talent agency um stigma and that that'll work dr harris l-three harris Go to him. Well, I can't hit him up since I have something already pending. So I'll skip him. That's all ready. Alfred Harris. Oh, there she was. So I found her. Human Resources Lead. So I'm going to go to her full profile. I'm going to go to more, add connection, add with a note. The note will say this. L. Three Harris, people operations leader. Brianna Pollard. She knows some people I know. Did she go to Hampton? Maybe she went to Hampton. Should go to Hampton. Cornell. Michael Savage. So I might even go like this. All right, I'm gonna go see if he knows that person personally. And we keep going down. global hr great thing is that they're in florida oops got that But it's basically like how it works. Except for sending this message, you wouldn't say I'm a talent agency manager back on immigration law. I'll give you another type of thing to send to them. But it's important that you put your LinkedIn profile as the right one. So now I'm just gonna do the top. I'm just gonna get the top of each one of these. Michelle Crawford. Craig Vick with General Dynamics. Let's go Christopher Yance. What business is that, BAE? BAE. Remember to go to View Profile. We have four mutual connections. Let me see what that is. Yep, I don't really know them personally. Oops, forgot to get my message. Man, tech. Oops. Got to copy the right message. S-A-I-C. Human Resources. And later we can follow up with an email to them, phone call. Sorry, I did Sarah Wang. We'll do this guy at Amazon. All right, then we'll do some more tomorrow. All right.

One, I want to say that we're very happy with your efforts yesterday and doing the reach out. That was a big, big encouragement to the entire organization. Yeah, that was a big, big help to the entire organization. And I think your effort should inspire everybody else. I mean, you're reaching out directly on the phone, having conversations without fear of rebuttal and got some interesting insights from those out there. So what I want you to do is finish your follow-ups for the people that said no, or didn't leave a message, just send them a follow-up email saying, Hey, we want to know more about why you were not interested so we can tailor our services there. I do have another task coming up for you that I was going to do today, but we're going to do that tomorrow. A reason being because we had a project yesterday that did not go, well, it didn't get the results that we need to be successful. And that is getting the contact information of contractors. So I'll present the, I'll present a screen. All right, so these instructions I'm going to share with you that I gave to Jonalyn for getting people on Ladders, Dice, and LinkedIn. So far it looks like we didn't get any on Dice or Ladders. So please get on there and look along with LinkedIn and kind of follow this up. And just to see what the problem was with getting a bunch of contacts on this list because we just didn't get that many. So I want you to finish your calls and then hop on this to support Jonalyn because we need to see what happened there that we didn't get the kind of results that we really needed on this big project. To show you where they are. You know, we're doing this on the My Visa Job tab, and you can respond to Jonalyn so you're not working on the same thing. But, I mean, we were really focused on trying to get companies like this. I sent a list of twenty. So over here, where are the list of those twenty companies? Maybe the list of twenty companies are not over here. Or maybe that might have been some user error. So let me go try to find those. That should have been in there. But here's a list of companies that we want. So maybe John, you can look at this too. Maybe they're wrong. I'm gonna put these in the bottom. So I'm putting this in the bottom of here. But these companies, there's no reason why these companies, they really need to be in the sheet right here, like today. Because we only have Northrop Grumman. We have nothing for Dice. And we just have a couple of things from LinkedIn. And these aren't really even military contacts. I mean, this is a Roblox is a video game type of thing. So we just need a much better effort. And I want these twenty companies. I want these twenty companies that I just put on there. These ones today. We need these done today. All right. So Jonathan and Joshua, please get on that. Joshua, kind of finish your calls and then let's get on top of that. All right. Thank you very much. Jonathan. Go blow your nose. This is inside the paper. Come to that. A little better? Okay. This feels really good. I'm going to leave it back. I'm going to miss it. Can I? Okay. All right. You see I'm giving instructions to everybody? Uh-huh. Are you trying to make another roadblock? Yes.

I think we got off to a great start on Monday. For one, Jonalyn really took well to her task of finding people in the defense space and good contacts at the top twenty companies that are likely to be good candidates for us to do the subscription service with and bring our first client on board as talent. Me, myself, I had two very good conversations One with a person that has a lot of H-B and top talent tech clients that's going to send some talent our way. So that's also a great positive. And Joshua was able to make some calls to existing companies on our list and was successful with getting some interest. So we're very happy about that. So this is what I want to happen today is one is I'm going to make a new initiative for Joshua today in addition to what he's already done is I had a conversation with a gentleman that's a tech guy and he had the great idea that there's a lot of people currently on H-Bs that would like to go into O-One so they can work their job and do their startup on the side. So I'm going to make some instructions for Joshua to kind of look up those candidates on my visa jobs and give them a call. And then Joshua also do the calls that you're already doing. Renee, I'm going to make some suggested pitches to go contact the defense contacts that Jonalyn was able to do. I might even do like a video on the concept-wise of how we're looking for approaching these companies and then give a couple of scripts just to get them started. at the end of the day what we're trying to do is for the companies is to schedule a short just introduction conversation with me which I'll give the link um to everybody to make that happen not with candidates only with employers candidates can't use that link for me I'm going to be contacting executive recruiters saying if they have people in their pipeline that need visas but they don't know how to do it I think they'd be excellent candidates for us to work with on that side. So that's what I'm going to be working on today. And I'll give instructions to everyone on a team that are clear. And we'll go from there. Thank you very much.",,,,,

I'm building a company called Legal Bridge. I believe migration is a human right and everyone should be able to live where they want to live. especially if they are happy to give their labor and their talent and I want to improve the state of immigration so building legal bridge.ai to support immigration attorneys uh use the latest technologies in ai and file cases faster and support more immigrants and focus on the high quality work of immigration which is strategy and being there for immigrants and fighting for justice then perfect Perfectly articulated. And one of the things I like about his service is it's geared toward extraordinary ability visa applications, which is something that's hard to find out there in the market. So what we thought to do today is we're going to try out the product ourselves, LegalBridge, and we're going to use Suresh Raina as our kind of template subject. He's a client of ours through US T10 Master Series and one of the most popular cricket Persons on the world. So it wasn't too hard to find documents about them, which is good for us because I wasn't prepared. So a quick Google search got us where we need to go. So let's get to it. So let's go to the platforms, what it looks like when you get in there. So click on create new application from the right. We're doing this real time. Yes. Suresh Rana. And we are looking to get him 01A. Yeah, we'll do 01A. Now, sometimes with these people, we go 01B because we can get some different things. Support. Yeah, support staff. But since he's an athlete, you can do that under 01A. 01A athletes can get O2s, not anybody else. Yeah. We can do plank. Nice. Oh, did I do that too fast? No, that was perfect. Okay. Now click on this application. Boom. And here just drop his Wikipedia page or LinkedIn profile or whatever you found. Okay, right here? Okay. Yeah. Suresh Rainer, Wikipedia. Now, typically immigration turns out there, people. Wikipedia is not a persuasive source, but it's a good place to start to go get sources. So don't do this at home. All right, so press upload. Yes. Look at this. It'll rename the documents for you. Oh, awesome. Do you have any other documents also like this? Oh, for sure. Oh, yeah. So that's how you know it's real time, folks. I'm over here still in Google saving PDFs. That's just to show you how efficient this product is. The other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to do cricket info. All right. It's player profile. That should be good to go. Yeah. We'll get his national team matches in there. All right. print that as a pdf and get back to what we're doing okay so let's put some more documents in here oh can I drop more than one at a time yes you can drop up to five documents for evaluation yeah all right so let's do it with three okay so we can upload these All files uploaded. Oh, look at this, what we're starting to get. So it's automatically going to give us an evaluation from these documents. Oh, wow. so it's going to continue improving the evaluation on the basis of more documents so let's say we just dropped wikipedia and it didn't have enough information so it will say like initially like yeah just look here it says uh lack sufficient details to support for these awards but now let's say if you drop something for the awards it will say like okay It does have. So it says these are the awards he has got, which will go into his awards. So, I mean, it looks like he has a pretty good track record here. Yeah. I was going to say, provided he lacks detail. I'm like, he's a World Cup winner. ICC champ. First Indian to score all three formats. He's a monster. He's a monster for sure. So now you see, like, it has compiled two documents. So it's going to keep updating this more and more as more documents are uploaded. I didn't even know he has an honorary doctorate from Vales University. Okay. Oh, so this is nice, everybody. So it's categorizing it by each category that we need there. And it's doing it pretty accurately. Evidence of significant contributions. Yep, that's exactly what I do. Now, as it's uploading documents, do we have a way to speak to this part right here and kind of like put our two cents in? Or we kind of leave it there and move from there? So for the evaluation, you cannot edit it. You can click on this button next to the evaluation called as download. OK, so go down? No, on the top of this, go to the top. Yeah. There is this evaluation text written on the top. There is a download button next to it. No, no, no. Just right there. Just right there. Go down. Oh, right here. This text. Yeah. Next to this is download button. Yes. Click on that button. Is that moving too much? One second. No, I'm just going to move this out of the way. Let me pause one second. I'm going to do some edits to the set. So this... This is PDF right here. And we can open it up and take a look. This is probably something we could even share with clients if you wanted to. Yeah. I mean, I think for clients, what I usually do is just like more of walk through them. That's like easier to understand their question. Oh, yeah, that's a great idea. Where is it going? I can't see it. One second. Well, wouldn't that be the same as what's in here? Yeah, it would be same. Did the download work? Yeah, hit the download button. Okay, now just download it. Let's open it. Yes. Okay. Yeah. So this is the evidence of water prices. Okay. So one thing to note, people, is that we didn't put a lot of information about individual awards. We kind of just put the Wikipedia. So I imagine with more context, they would know what international cricket awards were. But this is beautiful, how it breaks it down into each of the fields. So I'm actually very impressed by this, how they knew to put this in individual contributions. Is that something that attorneys don't even think about when they're thinking about like, you know, awards? Just because you won an award at cricket, if you're the first in your country to do that, you can also introduce that as individual contributions. So. Yeah, yeah. All right. Historical achievement, we like this, critical roles. Yeah, we probably have to actually put some contracts in to get the remuneration. There are some key points. Yeah. I like it. For us to only put four documents in there, they know kind of where they're going. Just need like more context. Okay. So what would you say would be the next step that we do from here? Now this is great. So first step is done. We go back to the platform. Back to the platform. Yeah. So now in the, at the bottom of this page, let's go to the bottom of this page. Uh-huh. Petitioner information, open that petitioner information. Okay. Yeah. So it has found Suresh Renna. What is, who is the petitioner? We'll plug ourselves. Yes. We're a global talent agency. That's a tip for you guys out there. Instead of calling him a cricket player, call him a world-class cricket professional so he can use awards other than his cricket playing. So if he's done stuff in leagues, if he's done a lot of media outside, if he's open business as products, he can use that there. Debra will say cricket-related activities. Oh, wow. They have recommendations there too. yes so we can suggest you some field of endeavors for this person I mean we will recommend you and you can choose from this by clicking on it you just keep my if I want to just keep my own I could just save and go next yes just say save save first okay did you save it right yeah now click on next yeah okay now so this first part is done so now go to the back to the top of the page So we just did through the evaluation. Now we are considering that Suresh and Raina decided to file with us. So we will go forward with the whole process. Now this is the playground. All you do here is if you don't know any document what it is, and you don't know where it's gonna fit in, just drop it here. And the system will try to understand where this can go in. So as of now, whatever documents we uploaded, the system will try to find where this can go. So as you see, all the four documents down there, these are the documents we uploaded. Should we add some more? Do you think we should get some more just so we can get some more context to see how it works? Yeah. So let's actually do a media article, just like copy the link of a media article. Yep. Oh, let me get this out. Okay. Just like copy, go to a media article. I did right there. Copy. Oh, you copied it. Okay. Now go back to the, yeah, go back to the platform, go to the top. Okay. Click on that right corner. There is a second button, right corner, second button. Yeah. This one. Yeah. Click on this. I think choose the tool link to PDA. Nice. And drop that document here. okay let's try if this is like yeah if it's like not a blocked blocked website where they actually have their traffic available for all then we would be able to extract it now a lot of websites are blocked so I mean we won't be able to get it but I mean if it is open we would get it Got you. And then if you can't, then, oh, there it is. Yeah, it looks like some information is public while some information might not be. OK. So it's conversion video. Hold on, hold on. Go down on this page. Yeah. So let's see if this, what is this document? Is this a good document? Yeah, I think so. I saw enough information. OK. So say that attach in Playground. Attach and Playground, nice. Let's grab two more. Team honorary doctorate, that's cool. So now we know what to do. Go right here, link to PDFs already up. Boom, convert. Let's go grab one more. Ta-da. It's a good one. Alright, so this one again we did get information is missing some of the pictures, but looks like it has the writing in there, which is what we actually really need. So it's fine. Attach some playground. And let's do it one more time. Love this feature. That's a different HTML. Let's see if we could do HTML. Yeah, it's like, you know, some media like New York Times or Wall Street Journal, you got to pay to be able to access it. So we won't be able to get such documents. I mean, no one can get those documents unless you like go through the paywall. But I think everything else pretty much we would be able to extract. Nice. And I wonder if I put the petitioner information there, would they But this. Let me try that. So it's like I was just curious to see if they liked it that. Yeah, so let's first add this one and then we can try the next one, OK? Or whatever. Hold on, it's working. Still working, gotcha. Yeah. It's doing its thing. Nice. All right, this probably is the old document so we can attach it. Yeah, playground. Okay. Now let's go back and then you want to try, yeah, click on upload. Yeah. It's renaming the documents using AI. So this document, I think we did not upload it. We did not extract it. So let's first extract this, the website, your website. Oh, extract it. Okay. Yeah. So do it again. Yeah, do it again. What we did is like we were extracting an old document at that time and then we tried to get that also. So yeah, convert to PDF. Yeah. I see I got I user error. User error. I was working too fast. I got too confident. OK. Awesome, so this is what it found on the website. Nice. That's pretty much in there. Okay. Yeah. So then we go to attach to playground? Yes. All right. Go ahead and upload. Yeah. So I think there were two websites. Let's delete the first. I think the first one is the one which threw the error. Yeah, so this one only has, well, oh, the first one, wait. Yeah, I think that one was three. Yeah, delete that. So delete this one. Yeah. Let's try now. Oh, I think we might have deleted the wrong one. Okay. Delete this one. Yeah, let's go back and upload it again. All right, let's do it one more time. Yeah, exactly. I think we deleted the smaller file. Yeah. It's no problem. Working fast. Convert to PDA. Oh, I wasn't supposed to do that. Let's go down now and click on upload the name. If you want to, you can rename it. Oh, There we go. Oh, maybe something with the thing. I would have to cross-check what might have happened here. Oh, no problem. I think it's the name or something, because I'm seeing it as space.pdf. So I mean, I changed that like that. That might be showing an error. I will cross-check this. Yeah, just like delete it for now and just like go to your website and download it and just drop it directly. OK. So that is a workaround. We could always just save our own PDF. Which we've now done. Just drop it. Drop it into grease. File uploaded successfully. We're back. okay so where are we going from here uh now yeah so now it's just like more of suggesting new criteria recommendations so you can select which criteria this document can go and this is our recommendation so you might say like okay this wikipedia article You know, when you go to this I button, just like hover over the I button, it says why this person, this document can go in awards or why this can go in original contribution. I would say this is like more of a resume. So you can just click on select all the criteria. Click on that button, select all the criteria that satisfy and just add it to resume for now. Okay, got it. And just like go down here and save it. Go back. No, no, no, on that itself. Sorry, I'll go right, save right there. Yeah, I see. Yeah. Oh, please. First one, go to the first one. Yeah, this one. Just here, just click on save. Okay, save right there. Gotcha. Yes. So now this document is done. Now the second document is this one. Go above. Open this article, click on that I button. Mm-hmm. go down here okay so this looks like a good article that you would like to have in the final package so now go out of this okay x out and I can choose the categories yes and we in the categories that we suggested you see publish material down there yep I see it right there yeah those materials and just go down and save it now gotcha and then we could also add our own right yes oh now what are these tags for Tags is if you want to highlight something specific about this document, then you can do that too. Okay. Got you. So save. Yeah, we saw an ESPN article. We could look at it. Dun, dun, dun. But, you know, we already know what's in there. Second time. Oh, and they give you tag recommendations too, like squads. Okay. I see it's like the tags as well. Let's do squad selection for that India cricket team. So we know it's national team membership. Save there. I'm starting to get it. Yeah. All right. Employment and critical capacity. All right. Oh, so this one's not that. This will be petitioner. Company documents. Oh, there you see. That's all. I like this. Glad you like it. Yeah, this is like how all your documents are compiled. You can see them. Now go to the next one. here in go to the top here so you see documents in every category so you see what is in resume what is in evidence so click on recognize prices recognize prices gotcha here is one document that we have uploaded now you can open this by clicking on the document oh click on document yeah so this just like basically whatever you have uploaded um It's it's the document is there. So you might say like, Hey, I want to add additional document so you can create evidence. I can add evidence here. Okay. Yeah. So, I mean, what we did was just like a quick thing. We uploaded five documents. If you are like, Hey, I want to actually generate a letter or something. You can do that too. So click on this. Yeah. Oh, one question here. Can we delete pages and. delete pages from one document like yeah so if I have one document like you know sometimes I have information that's not needed I'm just curious to see like what what that does oh you can edit what it's about okay no problem yeah no I think no I think that's a good question can you delete pages from a big document right yeah we don't as of now okay that's no problem so that's one of the thing to think about when you're using this product when you're saving your pdfs maybe just save the pages you need um to get rid of those unnecessary pages now look at this generate a letter of recommendation in this okay what are you writing what letter was it awards award yeah okay name recommender tall I cannot give an award to Suresh Rana. He's next level. This is so funny. By the way, these fields here are not mandatory. But yeah, whatever you can have, the more you can have is just like basically makes it more appealing. All right. We have Paterius. Yeah. All right. Well, y'all need to know that. You can speak. Yeah. Yeah. You can just like skip this. Yeah. So who is the recommender? You can say, I tell other wall is a, is a founder of legal bridge.ai. Right. I mean, I could just, yeah. I mean, my profile doesn't say much about what I do. Yeah. I don't think it, I don't, I don't think you can find much information. These are philosophies. Name of the award, ICC Cricket World Champion. ICC. What was that? International Cricket Council. All right. Day of the award, 2011. Other prominent awardees. Okay. Add your name there. You can add your name. Me? Yeah. Sure. All right. Award significance. This is the highest level of competition in the sport. Oh, is me spelling stuff slightly wrong matter? No, not that much. Additional details. That's fine. The best. Yeah. Go down now. Generate. i hope the award one um I have not tested award one that much I usually usually people like to use it for generation of uh advisory opinion letter the critical letter or uh original contribution letter a contribution yeah that's that's yeah that makes sense we're going fine Nice. Looks like it got generated. Yeah. As a philosopher king, our role as a visionary thinker is to grant me the perspective. Oh, and we can just edit it right in here if we need to. Yes. I want to ask you what engine this is running off, but I won't. Yeah. So this letter, I mean, we didn't add my details into it about like, because award letter I don't use. How about we do, let's try out a different advisory opinion letter. okay I'm not mad at this at all from what we gave it you know yeah yeah okay so so go to the last section go down actually here so I mean this is just like all the things are here now go down on this page at the end there is an advisory opinion section advisory opinion yeah here you click on generate letters yeah and click an advisory opinion Uh-huh. You can add yourself as an advisor. I think you would have your details very quickly. So we can do that. I'm going to look at myself. Wait, did somebody else have my name? I guess I need to verify myself. You can actually go to go ahead and say, download my profile. Oh, I can download my profile. Yeah. I think there is an option. Go down a little bit on this page and click on more download as PDF. Save as PDF. Yeah. Right. Oh, but this is asking for, um, oh, I can do it right here. Yeah. You can just drop it. Yep. This is great. So I can skip that letter of details. So document of the person recommended, just like add the Wikipedia page of him. Go down. So this is like the profile of your profile. So we have already uploaded it. Yeah. Here you can go down further. No, no, no. Go down further on that. Yeah. Now for this, just like upload. Yeah. Click on plus. Okay. Yeah. So now this document is used for Suresh Raina and your profile is used for you to generate the letter. Right. And we don't have any additional details. You can just say generate. Okay. Okay. I just want to see, like test with it. Say there is no recognized labor union, but this is the governing body in America. I just want to see how it incorporates that. Let's generate. This is great. Noah Alvarez, G League. Wow. That's me. I did that. I didn't know this. One of the first attorneys to do... Wow. I'm honored. Thank you, League of Legends. In my expert opinion, Mr. Arena's achievement placed him among the elite cricketers of his generation. He's able to perform consistently, coupled with his leadership, demonstrate extraordinary ability in the field of cricket. That's pretty good. Yeah, I'm happy with that. Yeah. Oh, my email out here. Okay, I like it. So I can close it? yeah oh and then you can export if you need to get it signed because that's the thing yeah you can export in pdf you can export the word whichever format makes sense to you all right do you have to where you can get it signed in the app no I mean as of now we haven't built that uh but down the line we will yeah I imagine that integration is coming yes uh so I said okay let's excel So now you have one letter generator. You can download it. You can send it to the client. You can get it. I didn't download it. Did I mess that up? Uh, I think you did not download click on LOR. So it's already stored here now. So go down, click on LOR thing. LOR? In here. Yeah. On the right side. On the right side. Okay. Yeah. This one next to socials. There is that icon. Gotcha. I'm looking for it. No, no, no, no. Here only. Action, LORs. Okay, got you. I'm with you. Click on this and click on the download button from the top. All right. Next to your name, yeah. This is great. Okay. Now it's downloaded, so you can open it if you want to see it. Yeah. All right. So what's next? Next, click on next button. Now click on exhibit. what it does is basically it takes everything and compiles them into a structured order so click on generate button here it just takes a little bit sometimes because we have a lot of documents click on forms add a new form yeah add a new form all relevant forms that you need to add 129 petition for my worker We'll need a G28. And we'll need 907. Awesome. Nice. As of now, these are not filled, but down the line, you can fill it, send it to the client and can get it like confirmed so we are adding jenny I do that now go to the top and see exhibit list yep yeah this is this is going to take a little bit of time to generate it you have the far okay now it's generated so open original contribution uh original contributions got it yeah so pioneering t20 cricket achievement international cricket now open this section open So this is the article and this is what it talks about this article. Nice. And now go to the second one after this. This one. Yeah. Open publish material. Go down here. You have these many articles that we uploaded. And, uh, you might say like, Hey, I want categories to be flipped. So you can say like, go to the close these, uh, close this specifically the category. Yeah. Close the category. No, no, no, no, no, no. Close it. Just like now move the critical role above publish material. Just drag it. Okay. Oh, we said go to publish material. Say add exhibit or new one. No, no, no. Just go to publish material and say move it down. I'm with you. So you can just double click it and drag it. Oh, I can drag it to where I need to go. Yes. Yes. Very nice. And you can even do this for the whole category. Oh, beautiful. I could do it for a whole guy. I could just grab it and then move it up or down. Try doing it for published material. Yeah. So you have now published material after employment in critical role. Beautiful. Yeah. So this is like more of a partner for the immigration lawyer to be able to organize it the way they want, generate text they want. And this is all now done. Now go down on the page. Yeah. Go further. Click on application order. Go above a little bit. Yeah. Add a new document section. Click on this. Add a new document. Let's see. Here. Add a new document section. Okay. Click on exhibit list. Search exhibit list here. Yeah. Generate using AI. So what it does is like it now open this document. edit button. So this is what we have uploaded. Love it. Now go out of it and click on attorney letter by the lawyer long version. If some attorneys prefer to have a long version. So let's try this. Click on generate using AI. This takes a little bit of time to compile everything that we have done. the meantime you can move drag the exhibit list above the exhibit section gotcha no no not here within that itself okay right right here oh yeah exactly so if you want it after the forms you can have it after the forms gotcha yeah got it after the forms Awesome. So currently the order is you have the forms first, then the exhibit list, and then the whole exhibit section. Got it. Just curious, like, um, I'm so curious about what's going to come up with this. Yeah, this one is, uh, probably took us a very long time to get here. No, no problem. I wonder what you're using back there. I wonder if it's llama. What you got? I think we have played around with all of them and have tried to figure out what is the one that gives us the best quality. Because the problem is AI can generate a lot of content. It's not a problem. But some of the content can be really bad. It's not worth even reading. so so just like generating the content doesn't work here you got to generate high quality content and make sure that lawyer doesn't have to do more editing of the content so what we have done is try to make sure that we get the best of the capabilities from every model plus our own framework in it to get it more of a high quality content it doesn't need to be like bulky content needs to be good quality yeah that makes sense yeah okay so this is generated now go above a little bit uh-huh it didn't show up can you click on add a new document again and click on cover letter let's generate the cover letter also um and refresh this page for now uh refresh okay Okay, so cover letter is generated. I think something happened on the supporting letter. Click on the supporting letter again by the lawyer. Okay, on added document, okay. Long version, yeah, which is generated again. Then I can move this around while it's generation, generating, right. So cover letter, forms, exhibit, exhibit list. One thing, if you ever got to start, you know, just upload the documents and it makes the forms, that would be great. Yeah, it is on our list to be able to do all those things too. Yeah, I know you're on top of it, but this right here, this is so usable. And immigration attorneys, I will be in your office soon. Or you can come to my office. We're going to talk about this. I'm here to help you guys out. Legal bridge AI. We are going to spread the word. You know, when I was trying to do this and the only part I got to was like the actual drafting, like the drafting part. Maybe one day if I get my courage up, I'll share that. little tool with you definitely no I mean I think we just yeah it's like you know it definitely takes a lot of time it appears like you know as if building a software is a very quick thing but I mean I think now we have been working for like 14 months in it trying to figure out the best way trying to make sure the quality is high um and that's like a big problem that we were facing in the initial days about like how to keep going when the quality is really bad but now I would say the quality has improved very significantly agreed yeah yeah that makes sense yeah all right so let's see generated successfully I don't even care what's on this thing. The fact that that is a possibility, we're living in great times. So now I just gotta remember where it is. Oh, did something happen again? Um, yeah, I think, uh, I think I would have to look into it because what has happened I feel is in the system, it is, uh, not able to compile all the documents together. So let's try other letter actually supporting letter by the lawyer. This short version. Okay. To me, lawyers out there, that's not the biggest of deals. I think that would have been a super, super Christmas list. But hey, you need to write your own covers. And there's some, see, I'm talking to my shop. Click on add a new document. Yeah, first one. Yeah, just generate this. In the meantime, click on this table format. The stable format, table format, got you. Yes. So this is like the O1 package that is generated. Oh, wow. So you can go over each document. So O1 first, then you have the cover letter. These are the documents in the cover letter. Exhibit list. And then you have the exhibit list. Wow. And then I'm sure it's going to follow with the actual PDFs. Yes. It's all. Man, I wish I've known about this. This would have saved. It's like this would have saved my marriage. I'm sorry. I didn't have one. I can see some people saying that, like, man, I could have been there with my kids. You're saving lives. You're helping raise a baby. You're doing something here. Thank you. Yeah, I think as we keep building it out, now I feel just like how I showed this to you. This is ready to go package in a way. And if you think all the time we have spent, like 40 minutes, you're like doing it for the first time. So it took 40 minutes. Next time when you want to do it in 15, 20 minutes, you will be able to get this done. It's like able to get to 70% of the value. And the attorney can use this to get a better version of it, you know? So... it's a more of like a base tool available this might mess around and maybe you want to practice it I'm back no I'm gonna stay away okay let's see if we got the support letter by the attorney let's open it up yeah nice This is like more of a smaller version, but if you would like to go in the detail, supporting letter by the attorney long version is also available. Like that is something which is like more of a 20-page document. If it doesn't throw error, it's like the big letter. That makes sense. That makes sense. I like it. All right, so let's put this below the cover letter. Well, some people like to do forms. Some people really like it like this. Put the forms up there so they get the credit card. So what should we do from here? So this is like your final results. So I mean, I think this is more of a end-to-end version. I mean, as a law firm, we have different set up for users, you're paralegal, so everyone can be in the account and you can have different features like admin versus user and you can know all the different applications. This is like more of a sample for an O1 visa. Similar to this, we have pretty much every visa. You can get the forms and everything also in that system. Gotcha. I'm a fan. I'm going to be out next week meeting with attorneys. Yes. So I highly recommend this. Being someone that's put together lots of O1s and P1s applications with thousands of pages, it's kind of like... realizing that there's fire and you can cook your food instead of you know have to rub it with your hands this is this is great it's all um this is this is great for it um I'm definitely going to be taking it to the field as uh we talk to attorneys about our petitioner service we're going to actually talk about legal bridge as well and in fact I have a couple of attorneys here in mind in charlotte that I know that do primarily extraordinary ability visas but you're saying it's good for all attorneys not just just extraordinary ability yeah now we have like added all employment based visas and even we are like supporting other categories like humanitarian and all so we are building out for whichever category makes the most sense as the lawyers need us so happy to chat with every category of immigration package our goal is to support more immigrants in whichever way we don't want people to be blocked in their potential because of the immigration system right now are you also doing p1s you have p1s too already p1s I have have not added yet but it's on our radar if we have a customer who is ready for p1 visas we can build it out very quickly all right I mean we have them all the time so may this be something we can collaborate on igta um legal bridge collaboration on p1s yes we can do that part yeah all right so As I said already, I had my recommendation. We're going to take it to the field. This is IGTA certified AI-based tech information. That's all. What do you got to say to the people? Very happy to, first of all, be able to perform on a live demo, getting this to you. So this is great, able to show it to you. I think in the end, I mean, you know, there is a lot of noise about AI in the industry, in immigration and law. I think in the end, what... I mean, I was invited to ALR Tech Summit last year where I presented this product and I shared my story. I think I look at immigration as a very important field for the world because migration is so important that talented people should be able to access. uh the whole planet and be able to create value and that's my mission and why I'm doing it and when I meet a lot of immigration attorneys also they also exist in immigration because they believe in this mission they believe in supporting immigrants they are there for the joy that immigration brings on helping someone live up to their potential be able to live a high quality life so my message is like looking forward to supporting immigration attorneys and how we can support more immigrants, be able to help them live their dreams. And that's going to solve so many problems. So all about like, whichever way we can support immigration attorneys, I'm all up for it and get back to us. Love it. I love it. So this will not be the last conversation we have as he continues to update his products. And, you know, even if we can contribute on things like P1 visas, we'll keep doing these webinars. I'm going to be pounding the pavement as I travel, talking about LegalBridge AI. And hopefully he'll mention Innovative Global Talent Agency when somebody needs a petitioner. We're all working together for the same goal. Yes, sir. Well, you guys all have there a good one. Atal, we'll be talking soon. Thank you.",,x,,,
"July.29,2024",Looking for defense jobs for danni,IGTA,Looking for defense jobs for danni,Looking for defense jobs for danni.mp4,Looking for defense jobs for danni.mp3,"All right, Jonalyn, I have sent you the information about Dani, and what we're going to do is find people for her to work with. By that, I want you to go full tilt on the type of companies that are presenting, find jobs that are in military and cybersecurity, and get the contact information to people that are about that. So like right now, we're in Booz Allen. You see I put military here. And so I want you to get jobs like this one. Right. So I'm putting those into like a list. And so for this list of companies that I'm getting, I want you to go find job, jobs that are in military. And I want you to find jobs that are cyber security paying around $200,000. Make sure that the company's listed, make sure that the visa, my visa jobs person is listed. Also make sure that the individual recruiters for these job posts are listed. All right. Let's kind of go through this senior action officer. What's that? IT services legislative planning. Yeah, so we like this. Just copy this link. Paraton, I'm going to put them in. Paraton, security partner, defense analyst. So we got a lot. We got a lot with Booz Allen. So if they're listening, we really want the people that See if you can get the recruiters. You can. So this is with Rand. Yeah, I tried. So, like, but there's a lot of military jobs that come up. Ideally, one that's cybersecurity, too. So, let's see if we can go back. Military, cyber. So, we do the search. Senior specialist rep. Corporate security specialist. We don't like that. Security, special, business development. So there's another Booz Allen one. So these Booz Allen ones try to really get the people. So for Booz Allen, look up recruiters. Do that today. Third party security not looking for that. So. Military was actually kind of better than cyber security. I'll get two more different companies. that we haven't seen before. So a lot of these are Booz Allen. We don't want government jobs. Seeing threat, Intel analysts. Copy that link, so that's Epic Games. Took down that one. Let's go to page three. Counter intelligence officer. Oh yeah, that's what we should do, counter intelligence. Oh, let's get this shot. So this is Arsefield. Arsefield. Arc field. Let's get one more. What's that counter intelligence? Let's look at that. Counter intelligence. Also on global trade compliance. That's a lawyer, so we don't want that. We already have Arsfield. So we can get more jobs. We want Raytheon. So let's look at this Raytheon job. and Raytheon needs to be in that thing as well. So now we're gonna switch to Ladders. Let's go to Ladders, exit out of all this. Let's go Counterintelligence. Go business, technical, information, staffing. All right, so we got some more of Blue's Island. So we really need to get in with Blue's Island. We don't need medicine because she's not a medicine person. We like this Torch AI. We need Torch AI job. So there's letters. Senior analyst. Health technology, auto liability, we don't have that. Senior director. Manager top secret. So we want this job too. So we can find client advocate, we don't need that. Or another physician, that's medical stuff. All right, so the rest of this doesn't look good. So then we can go military. But the fence, Seymour Booz Allen jobs, torch AI physicians, AI oversight physician, more Booz Allen. There's a EY job. That's a government. All right. So that looks like what we can do there. Let's just try military. We're getting the same type of jobs. So that's what we found on there. Now let's go to dice. Jobs in the USA. Let's go to refine results. Let's go to counter intelligence. Mission technologies. So we want to get them. Counterintelligence analysts. GIDT. Let's see what else we have. Intelligence officers, momentum. There's Perotin, who we've seen already. ABR. So we can find two more that we haven't seen before. Inside a threat. So we can get See activities. All right. And then this one. Now, this is what I expect to happen with these companies. All right. We use Apparatum as a example. One site, similar jobs. See the full description. Now, see, this one doesn't show. Oh, definitely put the link to the job description in there. Right? And then look at Mentum. See it's in Fort Meade. I want you to go to our visa jobs, employers. Look them up. So I expect you to grab that person, get their contact information. Just like you would for my visa jobs. I want you to get their LinkedIn, things like that. So I'm gonna look them up on LinkedIn. I want to go connect with him. I don't know. Hello. Actually, I just have it on a note. But then I'm also going to look that. Almost one o'clock. look up human resources yep you're right human resources journalists so get like these three groups see all people results internal team international team leadership so you want to get this person look for the ones that look like they're international So then for them, I want to do three people. Where's the person that said they're international? That's really good for us. So we want her to grab her too. All right. And that's what I expect. So not just get the global mobility person, but get like good contacts for each of these companies. Now I've already started getting some. But I'm going to get a list of a couple others, but that's how I want you to look for them. That's how I want you to look for them, and that's how I want you to get the contacts for each one. Let me go to chat GPT. Roll her out. use this profile and companies similar to the one I just listed. All right, so then the information for these ones, because we already have the other ones. I'm almost done, I'm almost done. All right, so I'll make this list of companies. So make one with just these. Go crazy on getting these companies that I'm gonna send to you. Huh? All right. Yes. All right. So thank you for your attention to this. Get on this one immediately. This is immediately important to our endeavors. Thank you.",,,,,
"July.29,2024",Meeting with Rene,IGTA,Meeting with Rene,Meeting with Rene.mp4,Meeting with Rene.mp3,"All right. Today is June twenty nine thousand twenty four. And we are doing some training on the basics of how we're going to get employers in the United States to subscribe with us on a subscription basis for both revenue reasons and for structural reasons. Now. The revenue reasons why we set our price, what we're doing is because it's industry standards. that recruiters, I mean, companies will pay recruiters, ten thousand dollars per job description for people that they are actually implying with on a contractual basis. So for us to charge ten thousand is actually not that much compared to what they're used to with recruiters that do it on the job description basis. The other part is in order to do the visas, the way we do them, where they don't have to be involved, we do it under us agent for multiple employers. So that contracts allows us to go to USCIS and show them that, Hey, we have a contract with this entity. This is not speculative. Right. So was that, was that part articulated? Well, what do you think? Sorry. I said, was that part articulated well? As far as like, what's the reason that it's priced at what it's priced and the structural visa reason why we do the retainer basis? I'm sorry, Sherrod. Are you asking me a question? Yeah, yeah. I was just asking him like, is what I just articulated clear? Because if I didn't, I want to do it again for the recording. It's totally clear. All right. So we're on our website, and this is usually where we'll see the tabs that are forward-facing for employers. It'll be like here, and then in our fact question, there'll be a lot of questions that they will ask as like rebuttals. But for now, we'll just go to cost and structure. As NICOR right now, we have two price points. One is for startups that are like companies are just like getting going. And the reason is they're highly likely to just have one off type of situations. And there's a lot of them. So if it's at a price point that that's not going to hurt them too much. they'll be pretty quick to stack up and subscribe. So, you know, if we have something where we're bringing on ten, twenty startups per week in the subscription service, that helps with the revenue compared to how much volume we'll do with them as far as like requests, because usually they're only teams of, you know, five to ten people anyway. Of those, maybe two might be on like a visa type situation. Unless sometimes it's the actual founder of the company that's looking to do this. In that case, we'll do what's called a petitioner service. Well, they'll pay us, in addition to this one thousand per month, we'll charge ten thousand to where we'll serve as the petitioner for their entrepreneurship. Because if you are employing yourself, you can't sponsor yourself. So you need to have somebody else that's there to serve in that role and then kind of articulate what you'll be doing in the United States, even if you're an entrepreneur. And then on the investor and enterprise level, that's where we're doing the ten thousand a month, which is based on what they're used to paying in the industry for talent agencies. They do want to retain basis. To do the payments like here, we have a back end that I've already set up with Stripe. And like, so when you look here, can you see it okay? Yep. So you see here, we already have it set up to like where we can charge the per month subscription. So they'll just have to sign up one time and then they'll do the reoccurring payments. Now we do have the ability to put in a promo code where we can say like, hey, if you're hesitant about doing it for the first month right away, we can stave off and give you a promo code to where you'll get two months off or three months off or even a reduced fee. Because honestly, the revenue is good, but just having a contract in place is what allows us to get the visas and open the relationship with them to be talking back and forth about what talents that they need. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a list of custom URLs for this. So instead of like having to get the link every time, you'll just have something that says innovativeglobaltalent.com backslash ten K subscription. And so every time you give that to a client and they sign up, That'll be fine. And it'll be quick. Let me see if this Dubsado is ready to go. Are you familiar with Dubsado at all? No. All right. Well, if I can remember, let's see if this works. If it doesn't, we can kind of skip it. But this is a kind of project management tool that we've used a little bit for when we have high-end clients. And I really like it because it presents a good opportunity to make proposals that like look really good. I shared, I mean, cause cause as you know, presentation go a long way, especially if you're going to subscribe to something. Let's see questionnaires proposals, right? So here's an example of one that we just made for the rugby. But imagine this says Wells Fargo or whoever that we're going to. And instead of this, it's like, here's a proposal for your Innovative Global Talent Agency subscription. And we make it individually for them. But in this, and I have somebody that can go and help make this. It might just be more of getting the team together. And I know that you've managed people, so maybe something you can help with as well on the details. But what I like about it is like we can have them fill out information about their, you know, we can just test it out. And then here we can have them click things about like what industry, what type of people they're into. Do they sponsor visas? Just to get information about them. And I'm just like after you. This one's not going to do it, but if you can submit on a full proposal, it could go to a contract that they can see. And then we can have the invoice right there. Right. And then we already have their CRM for the back end. So that's one thing I'm interested in doing this week is not just having to strike payments, but have like these proposals that we can easily go in, give it to a client. Have them fill it out. It goes to a contract. They sign it. It has the information that we need in it for our visa making purposes. And the invoice link is right there for them to just get signed up with their subscription. So on my list today was to get the instructions for this going. And then I'd like to present it to you so you can get a second look of eyes on it. Be like, hey, this looks good. And then hopefully by Wednesday, this tool will also be available to like when you prospect a client, they're interested. The proposal they get will look in this format, right online. They fill it out for what type of industries they're interested in. That automatically populates the contract. Then the invoice link is right there. Is that a US-based client? This one? Yeah. Yeah, this is one for the law firm. Law firm? Yeah. This, this is a client of the law firm, maybe major league players association. Okay. Yeah. So, so all this, so this is just, I'm showing this as a template because this one's under innovative immigration law, but we would make one for innovative global talent agency. And then the proposal language would be more for subscription as opposed to, you know, signing up for legal services. Gotcha. But yeah. So like, what are your thoughts on the format? You think it's too, um, Do you like more paper type of proposals or what do you think about the digital proposals? I'm accustomed to dealing with more paper type proposal where I can write and change and make recommendations before going electronic. What program platforms do you use to make them? I personally don't don't do that kind of work. I use my creative juices to make recommendations on how to improve. Oh, I see. So you'll tell them what to do, they do it, and they get it back to you. That makes sense. Yeah. So I guess after this, after I go through this thing, I'll go through the personnel, because there are people to tell what to do and get produced the information back. We're not starting from scratch on that part, at least. We do have people there in place. All right. So, but would you be opposed? Like, so would you prefer they give you like a paper one? Or like if they ask, like you can give instructions and they made one like this, would that be fine? Either or. Either or? Okay. Yep. All right. Do, do, do. All right, so let me show you the talent for the prospects. So now I'm switching over to talk about where our prospects come from. Who are we going to actually sell to? Is that division up and running right now? What's that? Which one? The innovative, what we're talking about here, which are the immediate goal, which is to sell projects that are either one thousand or ten thousand dollars a month. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, we're ready to go. That's up and running? Yeah, it's up and running. We just need to pitch. Okay. So you were saying we get the leads? Yeah, so I have a list of leads, and there's already mailing campaigns going out and stuff like that, and then LinkedIn marketing going out, and some direct emailing coming from the teammates that I'll introduce you to. Um, maybe we should do that first. We'll talk about like the team as far as like up and running. So the real up and running part is we got the contracts ready to go and we got the invoice leak ready to go on the website. We have the reference that you can go to to see why they're, why they're paying that. In addition, we have the rebuttal, uh, rebuttals already set up because I went and asked some employers, like what's the main pain points that you want to know? So it's like right here, what are the benefits of our subscription model? What makes us different? The main rebuttals that I got from them, that's why I went and made these different tabs. So, like, when you go to them, I'll have this, and then over here I'll have a video of me talking and addressing that immediate, like, question. Right? So, one, that's good to, like, if employers have questions, be like, hey, just go see our facts. And then, you know, also because it's like, hey, I have a question I want answered. I have the videos right here that explain it. the one part that I would like to get a little bit more automated is the contract part, but that's easy. Like I can do a contract, you know, any day, but I have the paper versions, but if I can get it automated, I would like that. But other than that, everything's ready to go. Payment link is there. The rebuttals are up. They want to go see the cost structure is very transparent right there. And it will, I'll let you pick what we talk about next. I can show you the team that we have available and kind of go through them or show like a prospect list. You want to see the team? The team, yeah. All right. When we had lunch, you were talking about a gentleman that's at MIT, for example. Yeah, yeah. So that's Franz. So I'll just put Franz on my LinkedIn. Okay. He's actually from Peru. He's from where? He's from Peru. Oh. And what's he doing at MIT? He's doing a master's, I believe, or a certificate in digital marketing. OK. Yeah. Global Holdings. very good guy so what he does is he definitely sets up ads he can do graphics um but there's two gentlemen that can do graphics um when it comes to like redoing proposals and stuff like that that's the person you go to so like hey we need a proposal for this if you need a graphic for that or if it's uh something where you have like a blog post idea he can go post that to the website But I would say he's more the digital marketing guru and doing adjustments to the internet presence. Okay. There. The next person, let me make a note of that. I'm just going to start a little tab where I'm making my notes. All right. So the next person I put in that same kind of bucket list is Joan Lee. John Lee, he's in the Philippines and he does graphics and video editing. So say, for example, if you're making a video, like, you know, you'd have access to StreamYard too, if you want it. I like it because after you're done recording something on StreamYard, you can download the text and do something like with that. So you can like download the text, send an email to Fran. So like, Hey, give me some content based on this text, go to John Lee, say, Hey, make this into a YouTube video or something that I could send out. And then he also makes graphics and he's good at paper proposals. I'd say the digital proposals are better for Franz. The paper proposals are better for Jonely. All right. And you need to take into consideration the time difference. He's in a different part of the world. All right. So yeah, so And actually the girls are getting them to like where he's going to be in a same type of like time block. But generally I give them like the instructions and then like, I have an expectation that there'll be there the next, you know, business day, whenever he chooses to, to be active. So like for him, I'm not necessarily expecting it to be like, okay, you know, back and forth. Although I'm going to put you in a group chat to like where you can add them and see if he's at, if he's up in the Google chat. Um, I'll do that today. Make a note of that. All right. So the next team member is a person named Johnna Lynn. That's different from Joan Lee. That's also in the Philippines. And they're actually pretty active starting at eight in the morning. I think they work at night. And what I use them for is one list gathering, data gathering. They are the ones that go and find clients and put their contact information in the spreadsheet so we can access it. They are also good at email based communication. So if you have like a list and you want like a certain message sent to them, like, you know, email this person, this person, they can do that. And those are the two things I rely on them for. One is our list building. So I'm training them on how to go to the different databases that we get prospects from. And I'll show you those and talk about some of the initiatives I have her doing. And then she is good for customer follow-up on a not too complicated basis. Here's an email template and go send it to that. Make sure you follow up once a week or something like that. They're good at that. And then as far as more complicated reaching out, we have Joshua. Joshua is also in the Philippines. He's pretty active starting at ten a.m. And he has a very good concept of the English language and also is pretty good problem solver. He's not scared to try to take on things. So I use him to go make phone calls, leave messages and do some more of the more complicated reach outs that, you know, aren't just like, here's a template kind of think through this. This is what we're trying to accomplish. Go try to go set some appointments. And they're also good on WhatsApp. As far as like keeping contact with somebody that wants to do a text type of thing. And then I need to make sure that we're supposed to have, oh, and my dad's here. My dad is on the team as well. And what he's doing is he's working with universities to try to get them to give us candidates access to their international student offices to let them know like what we do, both for entrepreneurs, maybe for students that want to do entrepreneurship, I mean, the executive placement searches for them. And then just for general candidates that we can use to put into our talent pool. And that's the team right now. I would like to add two people in Southeast Asia that's just going to be on candidate recruitment. They'll go and find people that have IT jobs, stuff like that, that might be interested in coming to the United States, because there are a lot of them, and then just kind of keep people coming through our talent pool. We had two, but I didn't really like them, so I'm going to give them one more week to see what they can do, and then If not, I have a list of some other recruiters that'll be good to go. All right. So I know that's a lot. Questions so far? If we go back to the basic premise, which is the firm needs revenue. And what you've decided to do is instead of running in four directions at the same time, if we go back to the graphic that I submitted to you originally, which is this division, this division, this division, this division, what you've decided to do is to optimize the effort, the cumulative effort of everyone to get the ball rolling on these one thousand and ten thousand dollar projects. Where's the starting point for that? Or is it already ongoing? Right. Let me see. So the starting point. is kind of here. We already have a list of companies that we know file for H-B visas. That's one arm. Another thing is Jonalyn's going through on laddersanddice.com and finding companies that are actively advertising for jobs that we know. There are not a lot of people in the United States that do, that have that acumen. And she's gathering those contacts as well. So that's where we start. We're starting with the existing companies that we have, that we've picked from this place called My Visa Job. These particular contacts are the ones that's been listed on immigration paperwork with these companies. The ones that are in green, I've instructed Joshua to go ahead and call with some scripts that I have to try to get them with appointments. The other list we have already is these are AI companies, most of them based in the United States that we know have a strong need for data scientists. And then one particular candidate that we have in that I think is a great place for you to start because it's going to be very niche is I have a lady that's agreed to work with us. She is formerly with MI six. Actually, she's currently with MI six, which is the UK version of the CIA. And she is a specialist in counterterrorism cybersecurity. She finds terrorists online. Well, she's already here in the United States on a diplomatic visa, but she wants me to switch her to a one and find her placement with a defense contractor. which of course is great because she's only one of three hundred people in the world that has her skill set. She's been doing it since she's sixteen years old, just off the charts. So I figure that that's a great candidate we can use to get inside the recruiting part of the major defense contractors here. And it's niche. We have somebody ready to go now. These defense contractors, a lot of them, I looked to see how much visas that they got, and it wasn't like as much as you would think. And it's something to where I think they have the money. They have tons of money. They have tons of money, right? They have tons of money. They always need ex-military. One of the things I told the lady that she would need to do for us is like, OK, you're going to still need an itinerary while you're waiting for your placement. So what you can do is recruit other people like you to come participate in the program. Right. So off of that, if we have, you know, even twenty candidates like her placing them for like revenue, those are two hundred to three hundred thousand dollar people of which. One, it wouldn't be much for these particular contractors to pay ten thousand a month for this type of service since they don't want to do visas anyway. And then second, it puts us in a really, really good niche for people that are going to be, you know, easy, easy to place. And I think as far as getting ready to go, that's what we can work on this week as far as like me and you just to get like the ball rolling. We have a candidate we can easily find who our employers are in that. And I think the conversation on that would be like streamlined enough that it's not like we're shooting all over the place with medical professionals, stuff like that. And so this week, if we just did that on defense contractors, pitching this candidate as the flagship talent that we're working with, I think we'll do pretty good. She's from London? She is. Well, she's from UK, I forget what actual city. I'll show you her. Let's see if I can find her resume. We must have her bio, no? Yeah, we do. For sure. Got all that. Pull it up. You good? All right. Five more minutes and then I'm back to the resume. Do you see that, Rene? Yep. All right. I have to squat even with the glasses on, but yeah. Okay. Well, I'll basically say so. A lot on her resume, basically, she's been in fifteen years with CIA. She tested when she was fifteen and scored like a hundred percent on this test. Because you're not really supposed to be in the military when you're sixteen. Her parents did a waiver so that she could do that. She's been actively deployed all over the world in conflict areas. She's done everything from drones to data science to doing defense aids, airborne. She's also a radar expert. Let's look at the bio. So one thing too, is as I get her visas process started, she's gonna give us the list of experts in her field that can maybe also be additional like clients and then provide additional context to what she's done. I'll just kind of breeze through her things. She's a native United Kingdom, transferred to the government communication headquarters in, She served with the British Special Air Forces, U.S. Army Combat Applications Group. So she's been already exposed to contractors here and she's currently here on a diplomatic visa. She's worked with various SEAL teams, Green Berets, Ranger Battalions. That's our best forces here. Australian Special Forces, Norwegian. She was in Afghanistan, Coalition Force. and has worked with various global intelligence agencies. Her last deployment was with British SAS in Syria as a targeter for the removal of ISIS and Al-Qaeda senior leadership. Wow, heavy duty. Heavy duty. Her distinguished and varied career included eighteen deployments to places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Somalia. She retains close links to the global special forces community and canine traders community, which is great for us. What's her end game? Her end games is that she wants to be with a private employer and get paid. I think she's been underpaid her whole time in the government and kind of stifled on what she can do. So that's why she's looking for us to, one, stay in the United States. She doesn't want to leave. And then, two, do it on a private contract where she can get paid. She's here now? She's here now. What state? She's in Nevada. Yeah. Yeah. So since she's here on a visa, all we have to do is file the O-one to change her up. But what I'm saying is that we can use her as a Trojan horse talk piece to get in with the defense contractors and start getting subscriptions. She said that she wants to be placed in Fort Bragg, which is here in North Carolina. There's a military base there. She said she has friends, but she says she's open. I think she's open. I think she's just really tired of all these like, you know, deployments. I think she's tired of war and tired of being underpaid. So instead of the military, it's more like Boeing. Yeah. Yeah. So it'd be Boeing and Raytheon and things like that. Right. There's a lot. So what I was going to do today and start is I'll show you. There's a couple ways to do it. I haven't tried it yet. I already saw Boeing. Let me do the way I know. B-O-E-I-N-G. Oh, yeah, that's right. So I just signed up to Ladder's pilot screen. Artificial intelligence. Let's see if something came up. Cybersecurity. That's one thing I have Jonalyn doing. Is that with Boeing? Locations, Columbus, Ohio. So even like this, cybersecurity jobs are up to like one hundred sixty one K, but they're not even military like focus. But my thing is, if I saw. Like Bose Allen, defense mission expert. I was just looking to see how easy it is to bring up the people. So sometimes on some of these things that we have, they'll also show who is the hiring manager on there, right? So I'll go, like even today, I already started making a list of defense contractors that make sense. And I can instruct John Lynn to go run searches like, hey, do defense mission experts, cybersecurity, looking for these employers. Do it in ladders. Do it in dice. And then here's the other thing. So. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Give me... Sherry, give me twenty seconds. Be right back. No problem. Thank you. Hey, no problem. You good? Yep. All right. So this is something called My Visa Jobs. This is where a database, they take public information from immigration petitions over kind of the past five years. So if I put in Boeing, it's brought up A bunch of these, like, so not just the big Boeing, but some of their other kind of operation stuff. The great thing about it is when you go here, most of the times they'll list the person that's in charge of global mobility. Right. So it'd be easy. We can just contact this person up, tell them like what we do, and that might be the main part of content that can understand what's the, uh, the value of what we're, what we're adding. We could also, when we start negotiating, look at how many visas they've applied for and stuff like that. So to me, this is good news. They're only applying for, you know, and it's going up how many visas they're applying for. And these are in H-B, which, of course, of these applications, they're not actually getting most of these. They're only getting of what they applied for. So we can even go to this person and say like, hey, we know you filed for thirty three visas. What happened to the people that didn't get them? Are you still interested in them? One thing our subscription service does is we can come back. You can give us those people and if we can put them on O-one, we'll bring them back to you. Right. So it's not even just the talent we have coming to us. We can go to these companies and say, like, hey, what talent are you interested in already that you don't do? Bring it back to us. We'll worry about the legal process. We'll come back to you. The displacement fees. Right. So what I'm thinking is like even this week, I'll get a list of twenty people. I know good prospects and we just pound those and see if we can get those interested close on the call using Danny as like our carrot and talking to him about like, hey, one, we already have talent that we're bringing into the table. And second, we know that you probably have talent you're interested in, but don't want to do the visa work for. Understand. Yeah. Senior product review is looking for a lot of issues. Go ahead. We've got a lot of this figured out. A lot of it's figured out. It's a question of executing the details and doing so consistently to make this grow, to make this happen, to make this flourish. Yeah. We're very far along the way. We just need scripts. We need activity. And we need some conversations. That's it. Everything else is ready to go. Okay. So then where's the low-hanging fruit? Where do we start? All right. So that's what I was going to get to. I think the low-hanging fruit is defense contractors that have current postings out for cybersecurity and military specialists We'll grab the names of their my visa job people. We'll go on ladders, look up their recruiters, go on LinkedIn, look at their job pools, gets their recruiters. We can have Joshua on the template at reach outs, like for like, you know, try and set appointments through voicemails. Like, you know, I have people sleep. We can have you on the more nuanced B to B business beating and stuff like that. And I'll be also on that as well for like the textbook expertise. So, It's more like Joshua is getting the conversation, like you getting like an appointment, like set up and kind of like managing, making sure the details on the outreach thing are good. And then when it comes back in, I'll be on the closing side. Boom. like I said first thing in the door we'll give you all that and then we'll make sure you get taken care of and then we can work from there but my main thing is like let's get this uh let's get this engine rolling let's make sure that these companies know who we are in the next couple of days right and I'll get the list of twenty of them I'll have john lee jonalin today rip through getting the contacts for each of those I'll send you the information on the candidate and the list of the companies. So you can educate yourself on like who those companies are. We can regroup like even tonight on like, okay, here's the stress strategy for tomorrow. I'll have scripts ready. I think like, hey, here's some good scripts for Joshua to send by email. Here's some good scripts like on the phone to get appointments. And then so by tomorrow morning, we're shooting to the market, educating. You do not envision... the need for face-to-face meetings. Most of this can be done via telephone, via video calls, et cetera. Well, I'd say at least to get them on. Then if we get somebody hot, then we can go look and see. Oh, but that's another thing is there probably are defense contractors in Florida. There are some here in North Carolina that to go see too. And I'll put a priority. So in our list, I'll put a priority to see if there's postings and recruiters in the area that makes sense as well. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that'd be good. I think that's where we start. Okay. I can even see us like, you know, being like a, a niche in military, like ex military. Cause like there's always ex military coming out and, you know, depending on what level they are, there's room for negotiation on like how valuable those, those people are. And they come from all over the world. Um, I think the term might be contractors for military. Contractors for military. Or defense contractors. Yeah, yeah. Defense contractors. Especially in cyber, they will stay away from kind of the violent stuff. Right. Yeah. Okay. I'm all in. All right. All right. So I see my, my week as it's unfolding, share it as absorbing as much information as I can. Um, jumping all over these websites, pulling down all the tabs, reading as much as I can. Um, that's gonna, that's gonna consume the bulk of my week. And if, if things pop up and there need to be presentations or calls, um, Obviously, I'm available for that as well. What do you see me doing? All right. So I'm going to look at a day like step-by-step as I'm looking at it. Yes, definitely do the education part. Because even today I have to get the prospect list together. So I'm going to get the prospect list together. I'm also going to send you Danny. That's the candidate we have already. I'm going to send you her profile so you can become familiar with her. Right. By tomorrow, I should have the drafts of like... I should have the instructions of what I'm going to have everybody doing for the week to support us because we're, you know, the most sophisticated customer-focused people. So we need the others to support us. So like, okay, Renee, what do you think of this plan as far as everybody's doing? I'm going to have the scripts that I've come up with for the defense contractors and the assignments for who I think should prospect who with which of those and like and how. We'll get the sign-off from you on there, and then we can pitch. Excellent. All right. Okay. Everybody's off and running then? Everybody's off and running. Mainly me. I need to go get these contractor lists together. All right. I'll let you go. Thank you for your time. I'll look for... I have a voracious appetite for reading at this point, and I'm dedicating my whole week to this, so... bring it on as fast as you can. Yes, sir. Will do. Let's get this money. And get me access back into that course. Get a course. I've lost access, so I want to get back in there and finish it. I think I got to about seventy percent of the course I got through. Oh, wow. Yeah. So for the part that you're able to get into, was it How did you find it? Clear, concise, extremely well written. All made sense. It was an excellent touch at the bottom for you to leave a video there as a as a first time user of the product. My constructive criticism would be that I was not able to see the video more than once because it would let me see the video. But then when I went back in to do it again, it wouldn't let me. So I don't know if that's a glitch or if that's something you're working on. Right. Yeah, I put primes on it to figure it out. I felt like somebody took me by the nose and was leading me through this complex web. Because when you're talking about intricate matter in law school, it's extremely difficult to grasp those concepts. This is good. It was good. All right. Thank you. Any more questions? bullet points on your agenda? No. That's it. I'm going to go get that done and get that done well. Shoot me as much information as you can. Don't be afraid. Thank you, Sherrod. I appreciate your time. Yes, sir. Talk to you soon.",,,,,
"July.29,2024",Monday IGTA - Week Focus,IGTA,Monday IGTA - Week Focus,Monday IGTA - Week Focus.mp4,Monday IGTA - Week Focus.mp3,"Happy Monday, everybody. I'm going to try to start a consistent effort to do this for the start of the week, which is let everybody focus on one thing, and collectively we all focus on one thing. Then also provide instruction for that up front with some context so that everybody can know why we're doing what we're doing. In this case, the objective is very very simple we are trying to I'll show you self subscriptions to the talent agency here startups at one thousand a month investor in prizes at ten thousand a month so basically to take advantage of what we can do with the talent agency and what we do with o-one visas what we do with finding candidates all these things We want employers here in the United States to pay these prices per month for us to do those services. And that's what all of the effort collectively that we will be doing and the instructions I sent out are about. We are going to collectively get some closings today on this, and we're definitely going to educate a lot of employers about it. So, Jonathan, you're going to find the employers that we need. Good ones. My father is going to be reaching out to talent places at the career levels with a lot of the Ph.D. programs here in the United States because they get contacted by employers all the time. They may not want to sponsor visas and there might be candidates that have job offers but are unsure about what they want to do with the visa. Rene, who is a world renowned closer of B to B business, will have him being lead head on contacting the companies that we think are good and going. Joshua, you're going to be second, but you have already a list of companies that we think that we've already identified. And you're just on volume trying to get conversation started, trying to get Appointments booked. Then I, on the underlying hand, will be reaching out to recruiters, potential stakeholders, things of that nature, and managing the whole process. And let's get some closings on this this week. As you hear information, get feedback from the market, be sure to bring that back to me. So if there's any materials that need to be changed, if there's some contracts that are being made up, we can be right on top of it. All right, so everybody look at your instructions. If you want to get more context, you can look at other people's instructions. This is one big team, one big goal. Let's do it.",,,,,
"July.29,2024",Rene B - IGTA - Context Video,IGTA,Rene B - IGTA - Context Video,Rene B - IGTA - Context Video.mp4,Rene B - IGTA - Context Video.mp3,"Hello, Renee. This is Sherrod. I'm calling just to give you a context type of video. This is my dad back there. On what the initiative, the main initiative for this week is. And that is we want to get subscribers from US employers to our talent agency. Now, typically, employers will engage recruiting agencies to search for candidates for job descriptions. The industry standard rate is ten thousand dollars per job description for talent agencies that have the privilege of being on a retainer. Other ones are just on contingency. But the advantage that we have is that we will also obtain visas on behalf of the candidates that they're interested in. So that's what sets us apart. Now only that is a service of getting the visas, but the contract set in place from getting the visas, the contract that we have as far as getting retainer is what actually allows us to get the visas for the employers without them being involved. It's what's called an O-one visa for multiple employers. And since they'll have that contract with us, that will let us tell USCIS that the work that the candidates will be doing for those employers that are subscribed to us is not speculative since they are putting forth revenue and they are putting forth a contract that says they're looking for these type of talent from us. Right. So I'm bringing this into the screen. This is the website, of course. This one goes to the cost structure. So for startups, we're looking to do one thousand a month to be part of the subscription service, and that allows them to do a couple of things. One is they can send suggestions of what type of talent they're looking for. They can look at our candidates that we have in profile once we have more there that they can go to a website and just kind of see what we already have in the pipeline. Then third is if they have candidates that they like, but they do not want to deal with the visa process, they can send their candidates our way and we can see if they're good for the service for us to send back. For people that are investors and enterprise level, and by that we usually mean Fortune three thousands and above, then investors pretty much speak for themselves. The rate is ten thousand per month and it does the same thing. But of course, they're going to have a lot more volume and expect more of us for in return for that the services. And that's what we're looking to sell this week. We want to sell those to employers. Now, we do already have a list of employers out there that we know that do sponsor visas at various capacities. Some of them are good for us and some of them are not because they are consulting agencies like Tata. That's not going to work for us. Communal Software Group. That is also the type that is a... consulting agency, not a direct employer, but people like this, Wells Fargo, Fidelity Technology Group is probably in that. Just direct employers. We have a couple more ways to go to because another good candidate that would likely pay for the subscription service are companies that don't deal with the visa process at all or have given up on it. Right. Other ones are AI based companies like these ones here that are in the United States that we know that could use AI talent to which we have a big database of. And we're currently having some of the staff get other high quality targets for this service. Now, what we'll go on over this week and continue to kind of formulate is how to best do the pitch so that we can get people involved. So one of the things is foreign talent services for H-B employers. This is where we talk about how if a employer is filing for H-B visas, likely there'll be a lot that they just don't get because of the cap. What we're saying is we will look at the ones they didn't get it and bring it back to them. Another one is executive placement. So if there's executive level physicians that are available at these companies, these are the type that we will go and search for individual candidates for them as part of the subscription service that they do with us. And there might be sometimes an additional fee on top of that for the executive part of it. But this is what we'll be going over next week. and really seeing how we can fine tune these pitches and give calls to companies that make sense. And of course, you'll share in the revenue of placing these subscriptions. All right. So I just want to give you some context and we'll talk.",,,,,
"July.29,2024",IGTA - Joshua Instructions - Monday - Calling employers,Training Video,IGTA - Joshua Instructions - Monday - Calling employers,IGTA - Joshua Instructions - Monday - Calling employers.mp4,IGTA - Joshua Instructions - Monday - Calling employers.mp3,"Hey, Joshua, how's it going? Liam, say hi. Liam, say hi. All right, let's get into your training. What I want you to do is I want you to start calling companies because we want them to have conversations with us to get them subscribed with us. so that we can provide them talent on the visa side. And there's a couple of advantages that we have for them. One is we do the normal recruiting services as finding placement. The difference is we also use that to handle immigration on their behalf. And we can also look at candidates that they liked but either did not get their H-1B visas or otherwise they didn't kind of work out. But we can maybe bring those people back to them. So I'm going to go and share my screen and show you some of the scripts and stuff like that we're working with and get you started. So let's share the screen. So I already have some existing ones for you to start out with, and I'm going to mark the ones in green that I want you to reach out to the companies. So I'll mark these in green or highlight them. Go ahead and reach out to that company. I'm looking for ones that do not have a lot of visas and aren't schools. So as you can see, these people have like a lot of them. But maybe we'll go a couple of them in here anyway. But what I want you to do is email and call these people, see if we can get on a phone call with the scripts that I'll show you that we have. So look for the ones in green. So that's them. Salesforce is like people alone. So here's the university. We're trying to save from the universities. So here, T. Rowe Price. Look at T. Rowe Price. Just call him and leave a message. American Express for citizens. Like this one. I'm picking them because they don't have a lot. Oh, and this one too. They don't have a lot of people that they sponsor for visas and they're not a school. So we'll highlight them too. Go ahead and call them. Ray Brown, we'll leave him alone. Equifax. What do we call Equifax? Northwestern Mutual. Let's see if we can find some. See, this is a university, so we don't want them. It looks like they're sponsoring a lot of visas. MSCI. They only have 23, so we're going to look at them. technology group I like that look at both of these utah companies so cloudbird call them fidelity call down So this one's already marked off. This is a school. That's a school. Ackerman. This looks like a good one. So if they're in green, give them a call. Cognizant. We're going to leave those alone. Ackerman in Rhode Island. It looks like one we can mess with. This Rhode Island one, NHA data. Let's look at them too. Montana is a school. Insight communication in Delaware. Go ahead and mark them up. Registrar Court, Deschamps Law Group in Hampton, Virginia. Follow them up. Mattel Energy Alliance. I think that's a big company. Wipro in Idaho. Go ahead and hit them up. And that might be good for now. So those ones in green. now let's look at what we're going to say to them so a lot of people are probably going to get a uh a voicemail that's fine these are the scripts that you can say in email follow-ups say call them hi this is joshua Now, if you can't talk to them, which is saying like, hey, we're specialized in helping employers find top-tier international talent and managing the entire visa process. We're founded by a former O-1 visa attorney, so we have you at Phoenix Edge to carry your O-1 visas. Can we set up a quick follow-up for managing directors for how we can support your talent needs? Okay. And then we have a few of these different ones. So just try different ones and kind of use this part if... If you have to leave a message, then we have the follow-up emails here. And when you do the follow-up, just go to make a tab in here that says they've been contacted. So you say contact notes, contact date, and then contact notes. And I'll make sure that you have this in your instructions. So you got contact lists. And then I'll get you this stream yard thing. So thank you very much. We'll definitely need to work on this because this has to go. This can't be something where we're not getting responses. We need to stay on this and get it going. All right. So I appreciate you.",,,,,

Here's Sherrod Seward, Nicole Thomas, and Roland Seward. We're going to go over a very important task that you'll do a couple of times this week. What we're going to do is find job descriptions that we think have a high paying salary and four distinct benefits that we think are high paying and high value in the United States. So I'm going to share the screen. and we can start the training. So there's a couple of different websites that we're going to use to find the candidates. There's LinkedIn, Executive Net, Ladders, Dice, and Angel's List, open positions. Here are the categories of jobs that we're going to do. Data scientists, AI specialists, cyber security experts specialized consultants non-clinical very important non-clinical so these are not doctors that need licensing and stuff like that but they're medical consultants that have the knowledge but don't exactly be patient work and then we're going to do blockchain developers those are people that do like cryptocurrency and stuff like that All right, so let's do some testing. And the ultimate we're gonna do is when you find these jobs, you're gonna go look up these employers on MyVisaJobs and create another contact list just like you usually do. So let's look up data scientists. We're gonna look at LinkedIn. So let's see, find me a senior partner jobs in my network. Find me a senior partner. Find jobs with AI. Just see that, find jobs with AI. Okay. Okay, I am looking for jobs in data science in the United States. I do not need a visa.

Exceed. So you want to go here to open it up. meet the hiring team, right? So what we want from this, when we see this, we want the job description link. So you can get the job copy link. So we want that in the my visa jobs thing. So I'm gonna put this to the side. So we want that link. And we also want the meet the, where's the meet the hiring team? We want this guy. So go ahead and grab his link. Right? And you want to put both of those into the spreadsheet, similar to what you do in my visa jobs. Right? And so we want to keep looking for jobs like that. So what I'll do even is So you see, I use this language to look at this. I'm looking for jobs. Please find me some posts. So I put the notes in here. Please make it hybrid or onsite. And so you'll go and find jobs like that by putting either data scientists, cybersecurity, or a specialized medical consultant, or blockchain. So that's how you use it if you're using LinkedIn. And we want the job description and the hiring manager in there. Okay? Now, next, let's do a training with Execunet. Bless you. So executive net, I'm gonna use this. Let's see, get start cert jobs. Oh, there's a recruiter director. Huh. Oh, for news, I'm actually every day for that. I might have to pay for this. I might have to pay for this. Go to premium day to find executive recruiters in your industry. If I have it up there, I'm gonna press the button. I do. You know what, let me just do 30 days first. All right, so I'm gonna put my name in here. So we can have an account. So we better use it, ooh. Password is innovative. Let's make sure I spell it right. Zip code. Current stage. We'll put C-level compensation. Put other professional consultant industry. Do we have to choose one? We'll put IT technology. We'll put technology. Oh, I think I put the wrong zip code. Hey, this is great. Yeah, it is good. So we can look at high-tech function areas, IT, and then we put cyber security. Yeah, they started slow, but every since they got cio partners top high talent number one recruiter oh okay so I'm gonna be on this so johnlin don't worry about that one uh we're gonna go to career center that's for us this is for recruiters okay so what's your career interests manage your job search let's go to the home page So now we know that we can log in, search jobs. Let's do an advanced search. Timeframe, we don't really care about. Location. Let's put job level. DEP and above. Select industry. So what we're doing now, we're doing cyber security. Let's go to technology, defense, aerospace. So we like that. Oh, we can do a couple of them. So we can go there, internet online. Healthcare biotech, we like that. Advertising. It takes all time. So the plan can talk technology again. It can go software related. Include entrepreneurial activities. So let's do that on that one too. right oh they can do job functions so it's great that's been thank you so let's shoot what do we have here we have a whole bunch of jobs okay so now we can look at the salary range director scientific and chief executive officer So these are some big level jobs right here. Chief operations officer. Now, if I'm looking at this, we want to look for ones that are more technical. So these ones that say, okay, let's look at job functions. Let's go to finance. So let's just look at operations, manufacturing, supply chain. We don't need sales. We don't want marketing. Info and tech. So we can click all of these. Then we'll put in other two. Now we'll go to search. And that brings us down to 224. So these are the ones that we're looking at. They're looking at equity stuff too. So these are the type of jobs that we're looking at. Chief of staff, enterprise AI. We like it to be more than 120K stock options. Chief of staff generated AI. Right, so we'll go into these. All right, so the thing here is this one doesn't actually tell us who the person is. So maybe this one won't be the best. This won't be the best because we can't see who the actual employer is. So maybe exactly, and that is not the best for us. So that might be something that I will, huh? No, no, they're executives, but they don't show you who the company is. So right now I'm making a training for Jonalyn to go find opportunities that we can call later. So this might have to be a higher level staff person to work this particular list, right? So Jonalyn, don't do executive lit. So like, no executive. Okay, so we can forget that one, but I'm going to put that in my notes. I'll put that in my notes to use that maybe with Renee. Okay. But you can't use it for a recruiter directory. Let me make that a note. Chief of staff, generative AI. This is great, but if I had people, All right, but I like this. That's gonna come in handy. Once you have the candidates there, they can just go to an apply like event, because they don't have access to it. And these people don't probably wanna get visas. All right, so let's look at ladders. Ladders, what do you do? Current compensation, we're gonna go to desired compensation. We're gonna put 200,000 plus. What do you do? Okay, so like this one, this time we'll go to the next one. We're a medical consultant. Specialized medical consultant. What are we in? We're in Latin, okay. Healthcare. All right.

Now we gotta sign in. oh we gotta get a membership fine gotta invest in ourselves actually yeah we're pushing up grace because we're trying to get started we're trying to get popular okay so we gotta keep this moving right now upload your person All right, so let's view jobs. 50 recommended jobs, medical physician, physician, physician clinic medical director. Okay, let's open this up. Oh. Let's go to search jobs. This is the jobs that 610 provided to us. Gotta save searches. You don't have any saved searches yet. How do I do a search? So let's go back to ladders. Edit preferences. How do you think you do a search? Oh, search jobs. Let's go medical consultant. It's a 6.5. talent acquisition, manager, industry, healthcare. So we're doing medical consulting, healthcare. So medical director. Worldwide, over 20 million people are living with Parkinson's. And so many places to search for information. It can be difficult to know where to begin. The Parkinson's Foundation has answers. Answers for everyone in the class. Oh, yeah. So we're looking for jobs that don't require somebody to put their hands on people. Research help you find local support. but like you know but here let's let's try data scientists data scientists so we've got artificial intelligence oh let's go back to jobs artificial intelligence search okay position level experience the next frontier z-suite this one This one. This one. All right. So senior AI engineer. This is something that we're looking for. It's even in health care, right? Good salary. So this job is a little underrated. We're not working for this person who has issues. What? What did they say? They're supposed to have issues. So look, we got the job. How do we save this? Anyway, what you do is go for Virto. So you have Virto, and we would like to apply. Unload your contacts, drop your resume. All right. So what we do is get this from My Visa Jobs. for my visa jobs, Virto, search. All right, so look, perfect. Virto has only applied for three LCAs. You're at the Human Resources, go find them up. Also, look on LinkedIn and do Human Resources Virto. So it says it's Michelle Redine. Is that the same person? Jason Bloom. So get both of them. Put both of them as contacts and also see if there's more contacts in here. So I want Jason, I want Michael, and I also want, so Jason is in there, but get this person too for Virto. All right, so that's how we'll use ladders. So you click Senior AI Engineer. If you can find a link somewhere on there, put that on there. But it looks like this will be good for artificial intelligence. Notice that I didn't put a location. You can actually get rid of remote. make it someone that has to be in person this is better like even look at this innovation leaders these are all people that can be placed by us so these are the type of companies that we want look them up in here make sure you're not applying for that many visas put them in the thing okay now we're in dice oh what was the last one we're looking at password. Settings. Talk about getting to my visa job. Now we really want the jobs at $200,000, but jobs at $160,000 is fine too. Okay, so that's how we use that. Now we're into Dice. Let's look at Dice. So let's bring the login register. Wait, are these? Nuclear engineer. Wow. It's going to the buyer. So we want them in the United States. Search term. So that's on site. So we want hybrid and on site. Employment time. Do what, sir? Willing to sponsor. Look at this. Willing to sponsor. Employer type and there's recruiters too. Let's look at the recruiter jobs. 150 jobs. Junior Python developer. Let's look at full-time jobs. IT Associates, Inc. General Accountant. Enterprise. Yeah, so these are... This is good. So this is a recruiter, not the person that's doing the job. Really, we could be putting job descriptions up here. We could log in and put so-and-so into a talent agency for yeah so for our notes is uh make recruiting jobs for my gta on so let's look at this company right here let's say they're a recruiter that does business advanced search oh that's what employers just looked up diligent technologies So look, they have no H1Bs. He actually looks like somebody we need to talk to and work with. So go ahead and load them up, but make the recruiters be recruiters. There's so many places to go. So it's like this guy, he looks like he's traveling to the Southeast Asia, but he doesn't file for any visas. So if we like, you know, I might eat them like this. Yeah. There you go. We got away a little bit. You're fine. I am doing something. You don't have to wait. Did you just do that? um um Right, so actually what I want you to do is go to the direct jobs So there's a lot we can do with this get a mix So we want some that are willing to sponsor and some that aren't but we don't want I don't want you doing the recruiters. I want you to do direct hires. Okay. And we want to look at the full time people right here. So look, these people are in Raleigh. Maybe look for the people like next to us. So you would go to, Hey, I got you. You just gotta wait. Cause we're in the middle. Okay. You're not gonna die. You're also cared about. Are you sad? So we'll go to employers, put them in, go kind of check them out. So they're not even in here. So then go on LinkedIn, get all their contact information. Is there a way to, so let's go into the job. and see if there's a way to share, right? So you can copy that job, and then you can meet the job poster, right? So in here, we want that, and we want the job poster. So on Dice, we want the job, and the recruiter, which was... There it is. Oh, what was it? So you can view his profile. He doesn't have any emails posted. So you can just go look him up on LinkedIn since he's there. Yeah, just put it up. Director of Sales and Recruiter. Oh, she's not even here in the United States. So that's cool. Yep. See, just holding on. You did a good job. Okay. So that's how we're going to use Dice. And like, if you want to get more precise, we'll be at cyber security. So I think it's more like core jobs. Technically, technical manager. Yeah, you look at these jobs. Okay, so that's how we're going to use Dice anyway. But I think Dice will be one of the better ones for us. The next one we're at is Angel's List. It's engineering. So we're not going to be doing business operations, customer service. We write product and design. We can be there, but right now I'm going to be in engineering. Is that it? At Angel's List. Oh, you know what? This is not going to be a good one to use. We're not going to use this because they're only showing us jobs with them. Yeah, these are Angel's List jobs with their team. Yeah, so that's not going to work for us. So the three that are going to work there are LinkedIn, which is all right. We got Ladders and Dykes. LinkedIn ladders and dice that's what we're going to work with. In those we're looking for these. For financial quality yeah. you're looking for these people. Okay. so I'm going to get this video to you um considering this a training I want you to get this started on this monday we're looking for high salary jobs and these get a mix of different spaces and on dice remember to do some that are sponsoring visas look for some that aren't sponsoring visas and we'll go from there so that'll be your training for monday but it'll probably do this three times this week and this is very important So thank you very much for your efforts.",,,,,

This is Sharon and Roland Seward. And today we're doing an internal training talking about how we're going to approach colleges and universities for the International Student Initiative. All right. So the basic idea is we're trying to get schools that have STEM related graduates at the PhD level to partner with us for a couple of reasons. One of those reasons is that we need top level candidates that we can in turn try to place with our employer partners. Second is we're trying to get a good rapport going with the schools so that they think of us when they have these opportunities. And third is we can do placement. We have three things we can do. One is somebody can enter our talent pool and then wait for us to find something that matches their skillset. The second thing they can do is pay us to do an active search for them to go find a placement. The third thing they can do is if they are an entrepreneur and want to stay in, they can work with us to get an O-1 visa and stay in the United States, and we will do their itinerary for them to help them stay while they build their business. All right? So now I'm going to share my screen as Innovative Global Talent Agency website to kind of talk about these resources and what we do. So we'll look at the first thing that if somebody wants us to enter our talent pool, we'll have them. So we're at the website. We'll go to Foreign Talent Services. This is for somebody that just wants to enter our talent pool. We'll have them go to that. And then they can schedule a consultation or just make them contact us to get into the pool, and we'll contact them back. So any type of candidate that just wants to see what we're about and get evaluated to see if we want to place them with our partners, they can just go to this tab, which is the first one, Adventure Community USA, and do that. Got it? That's a great idea so the kind of the Whatever you said, the career placement people should also be included in the list of people to contact along with the department chairs. Oh, nice. So that's option number one. The second option is when somebody that's like, I want to be... but I want you to look for something for me, like more of an executive placement thing. So one is like, we wanna enter our talent pool, we're gonna fine contact you once we find something for you. Like for that, the student doesn't pay us anything to do. Now, if the student wants us to be an executive placement, it's like, hey, what are your skill sets individually? We're going to put a project together just for you to go on to the marketplace. That's when we do the executive placement. And there's a charge for that, $10,000 for the executive placement service, and then also $10,000 for the visa. So it will be both at the same time. You like that? Yeah, buddy. Huh? You want to get mad at me? You want to get mad at me? Go ahead. Do those field schools have somebody that will get them a visa and actively go search for them to go do? Are they just going to like, hey, if you're in contact by the school, put a contact and figure it out. I'm sure that these tier one schools have employers. But again, don't the employers often get away from sponsoring visas or doing H-1B? That's the whole reason why we're here. Because schools don't do O1 visas, and then a lot of the employers don't. O1 visas. That's the whole key to all this. It's for the students in the placement offices, right? Right. And sometimes they don't want to work for it, but they want to do their own thing. Then we can get an O-1 visa for them. And it was basically executive search to where we have to have a job. You can't just do it for yourself. So what we do is they can do a little bit of stuff for the firm or somebody like we work with a little bit on a project that we opened up so they can still open their own. Does that make sense? Yes. So this is the university. Got it. So what are the three things we can do? So one. they can get into our talent pool and then like we contact them back when we feel like we have something that's kind of working and then like we'll get whether we start the visa process like at our own that kind of reason the second one is where they do an executive placement where they'll pay a certain amount of fees 10 000 to where we get the white no we didn't they know the experience Because otherwise, if they're in the talent pool, they're waiting for us to find something for them. And then we get the visa process started at our leisure, like when they get paid. But we do the executive placement, and they pay us, the student does, and then we'll actively work with them. Like, okay, what do you do, what do you do? And they'll actively search instead of waiting an opportunity to come to us that matches them. And then we'll also file the visa, like, right away, because they're paying for it. All right. And then the third thing is if somebody wants to be an entrepreneur, it's the same price as our same kind of process if they're doing a placement. But instead of doing a placement, we're doing a unique kind of services thing to where they just do a little bit for us, a little bit here, but it allows them to still be an entrepreneur in the open season. because otherwise they couldn't do it. They can't really just stay here without fighting themselves on an O-1. They have to have a petitioner and they have to have an itinerary. So basically we act as a petitioner and we put our itinerary together. So that's where the first one is. And then this is the executive placement services. And that's the ones that you use. All right. Great training.",,,,,

"July.21,2024",Sherrod Seward x Rollin Seward - O-1B Conversation,Other Video,Sherrod Seward x Rollin Seward - O-1B Conversation,Sherrod Seward x Rollin Seward - O-1B Conversation.mp4,Sherrod Seward x Rollin Seward - O-1B Conversation.mp3,"Hello, whoever's watching this video. I'm, of course, Sherrod Seward, and this is my father, Rollin Seward. Say hello. Hello. What you're about to see is an organic conversation about why we need to get folks that we can put under O1B visas into our talent pool. We need them to fill out a candidate sheet, and we need to sign them up to our program. To go back, you know that we do O1 visas, but there's two types. There's O1A and there's O1B. Typically for business persons, computer scientists, we're getting them O1A visas. The problem is we can't get a central support staff. When we put somebody under an O1B visa, we can then go and say like, who are the important people that you work with? And we can make one filing and put 25 people on it that are close to them. So instead of having one person on an O1A, we have one person on the O1B visa And then we have up to 25 other people from one filing too. So that's the difference. Now, how do you qualify somebody under the O1B visa? They have to be more than just good at their business. They also have to have an influence because it's typically used for people that do journalism, people that do motion pictures, models. But we're using it to say that you're an influencer in addition to your acumen in the field. What are some examples of this working? We have an example of this working with a combat sports promoter. We say, yes, you're a business person as promoting fights, but you're really doing production for a TV show that just happens to have fights. So therefore, you're influencing under 01B. We do this for certain athletes that are also doing commentation. So we're saying like, yes, they are an athlete, but they're doing commentating on ESPN, on that show. So focusing on that, they're more of an influencer. As far as a business person, we did Shaji Omuk, who's a $2 million guy in the UAE. And we said that, well, he does regular appearances and writes co-ops on the media all the time. So we got that going as a O-1B. All right. So with that said, I'm going to let him ask questions that are likely to be the same questions that you would ask. So I can fill in the blanks. And so you can learn of what to say to the people that you're trying to get to fill out the candidate sheet. How many people in your influencing network? What do you mean? I mean, I mean, OK, I'm going to take him to say how much influence does a person need to have to be eligible for the OMB? Right. So one of the things we're going to do is we look on social media and we put in their industry. And so. Some industries that are very popular, like computer science, you might have to have more followers. So we're looking for people that have like 70,000 followers. If you put a nursing practitioner, it might be less. So, you know, usually everybody only has 20,000. So if somebody has 30,000, they're good there. We look to see what type of press is written about them or better yet, what type of press they have written. so if they have contributed to forbes or whatever industry thing that they have there that would be good if their business that they have has been uh presented awards on shows that shows as well um if they've made appearances uh doing news articles and things of that nature That is something too. So we're looking at their following on social media. We're looking at their appearances in media platforms, and we're looking for their original contributions that them or whatever they made might have put waves in in the world. One more question or question. Is there a particular is there a Are all fields eligible, all fields of influence eligible? Does it have to be scientific? Does it have to be medical? Right. So the fields that we're looking on are specific that have working shortages in the United States. That's why we're focusing a lot on IT, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, nursing, plane maintenance. aviation and probably like robotics. But whatever, like we're going to give you the industry that we're looking in. And then the job is to find people that are good at it, but looking at it through on YouTube, looking for them on Twitter, looking for them in news articles rather than just what did they win, like win an award. Because we're looking to say like, hey, this is an influencer in that space. And The other thing would be great, too, is if they happen to have a business or an infrastructure, because just because somebody is an influencer doesn't mean that they have people that work with them, that we can get the O2s. Because that's the main thing that we get with the O1B is that hopefully that person has contractors. They have other people they know that we can put under O2 visas. The next thing you know, they're in our pot of eligible people. And we only had to do one filing, saving us. almost like $80,000 in filing fees and getting 20 people at the same time on board with the visa process. So what are the steps about the cost saving? Why is the cost saving process? It's cost saving because typically we have to get individual visas for everybody, right? So if we're only doing A01A visas, number one is we have to find individuals that are only at the top of their field. This is going to be very important. The 01A, 01B, that individual that has it has to be at the top. They can't be mid-level workers, right? But when we do an 02B, so there's two things that are very, very beautiful to us. Number one is we can put 25 people on one petition instead of having to do individual filing fees for each one of them. Does that make any sense? So for one petition, you have one filing fee, but each individual visa, there's still a fee associated, correct? Wow. So I mean, I understand. So you don't need a filing fee for every one, but just you still have to. Yeah, one filing fee. Yeah. So for O2 visas, I can put multiple people on one. So I can pay one filing fee and put 25 people on as long as they're they're associated with the main person that has it. Now, here's the thing. Now, here's the other thing. The eligibility criteria, how good they have to be, is de minimis. They don't have to be one of the best in the world. They just have to have a skill set we can prove that is helpful to the main person that has it, right? So that way we can get a bunch of mid-tier workers in this visa category without H1Bs and elect worker Bs. And how long does the visa last for? How long does the visa last? The visas last for three years. All right. So I'm going to recap why this is important. So 01A is fine, but we've got to do 101A at a time and we can't get essential support staff. The 01B, we get the ability to get essential support staff. We want essential support staff because they have less of a of a bridge that they have to reach to be eligible and that we can put up to 25 of them on the same thing. So that's why we really want to focus on finding influencers in the industries that are important to us and get them to fill out that candidate sheet and be a part of this program. That is the home run. That is the holy ground. We want these people to be influencers. We want them to have businesses with people that we can prove they work with. They have a bunch of pictures together. They're like, hey, this is my publicist. These are my computer engineer guys. So let me give a best case scenario. Matter of fact, let's get into it. I'm going to present my screen here. So let's find this. So we go to YouTube. And you want to say, we want to find AI engineers. Like say, how is AI growing in China? Or here's another way to look at it. You go to chat.openai, and we're going to say, please Give me a list of Chinese YouTube influencers that deal in artificial intelligence, preferably those that have their own AI agency. Let's see what it comes up with. First virtual key opinion letter. I don't think that's a real person. All right, platform with WeChat. over follower before restrictions. I don't know. Is he on here? So they give us some options and then we can just look the guy up, see if he comes. Oh, Well, China has a lot of restrictions. Maybe that's kind of hard. India. Yeah, let's do something else. Okay. Do the same search, but for India. Searching, searching. Now, the thing is, to be honest with you, we already have a list of the influencers picked out already. I just want to show you how to search for yourself. Virtual, no, no. They have to be real people. These need to be real people. Not virtual. They're giving me people that are not real. They're saying this person has been created by. Oh yeah. See look, she has this many followers on LinkedIn. She's great. Worked on various projects. Founder of studios. He's created virtual influencers. He specializes in, yeah. Founder of meta labs, influencers. These are the type of people that we like. So say, give me 20 more people like this. What program is this? This is OpenAI Chat GPT. Do you have any paper subscription for that? Yeah, it's like 20 a month. It's cheap. Yes, it is. So then, once we have their information, chair, engineering, ITT, Bombay. Sometimes these guys can be hard. IBM Research. So like, no, do not, Give me persons at large corporates. I mean, I guess we could coach them maybe. Give me independent. Now, the reason we might not want people that are at these big corporates is because they aren't likely to leave. And if they do like leave, like leave. you know, we might mess up our relationships here in the United States. We're trying to do business with IBM. We look like we're taking IBM's head guy in India and, you know, moving them over to Microsoft along with half the staff. Yeah. Smartphone tips, mobile review reviews, and boxing text reviews. Okay. Persons that actually try to build software and apps and AI stuff. So these people, they gave me some people that do like tech reviews. While this is fine and doing reviews, that doesn't mean they actually make anything. or that they can do anything. So like just because somebody does a tech review doesn't mean we can get them a visa and get them placed. We're looking for people to actually have technical skills. The founder, yeah, this founder, Cogni Tenser, whatever that is. So we can go look for one here. We know it's with Tenser. Is he in the United States? Of course they would give me a guy in the United States. I had a note say, I'm excited to learn more about your content. Oh, look at this guy, technical recruiter. In Greater Boston. I don't want him in Boston. Okay, let's say it's like, make sure these people are actually in India. All right, so we're going to look up this person. Oh, look, we got them. So look, we found exactly what we're looking for in Mumbai. Perfect. So what you do is go to them. They see that they have 18,000 followers in the space. And then we'll go to more. One is to get their contact. Get their contact. Try to find their phone number. LinkedIn. Let's get in front of these people. Who else we got? Data preparation. Scribble data. They'll go here. See if we can find them. LinkedIn scribble data. 7,000 followers, not a lot. But, oh, this is great, too. So if they have a lot of things where they go and present at panels, like I'll be on Gen AI for a business panel tomorrow. That's the type of things for the Fifth Elephant Conference. That's great stuff that we can use for influencing, sharing a lesson. He's making lessons for the cross-border engineering team, which is meant for startups in the U.S. What is that in the U.S. Indian Corridor? What is that? I need to know about this US corridor. So I'm going to hit them up and say like, hey, I need to know what that is. View full profile. I'm going to go like this. More. Connect and send a message. Hello. I saw your post and it mentioned the US India corridor. I want that. Looking forward to your content. Yeah, so let's go see what I got. AI solutions for agriculture. We love agriculture. It's big. executive talent acquisition wait who is that oh and whom who's this guy this is hey how many powers do you have so I want him as ends our executive talent acquisition let's message him too I'll put in my notes over here because we do need some people But I hope that you find this helpful. And somebody look up all these contacts. I'm going to paste this and give it to Joshua. But that's why we need to find these influencers and we needed them in the program, especially the ones that are business owners, that do a lot of press, conferences, learning lessons. and that have businesses that likely have other people working under them, because we need to bring them all here to the United States and place them in contracts and full-time employment. Thank you for your time.",,x,,,

Previous to that, I operated one of the best law firms in the nation that only specialized in O-one, P-one, and E-B-one-A visas. And I'm bringing this up for a reason. It's because I think that you, in particular, are a great, great candidate for me to get an O-one visa. Using this O-B visa, I can give the opportunity for yourself and all the people that work with you to get direct access to do projects, contracts and full time employment with Fortune three thousand companies in the United States. How does it work? Well, one, the O-B visa, there's two versions, the O-A and the O-B. the o-one a is traditionally what's more appropriate for persons like you that I think excel in business however I did my research very closely and I think because you are forward-facing you're an influencer in your field and a force to be reckoned with as far as having influence on the ones around you in your region that I can get you placed in the o-one b category The big difference is that O-one A's do not support what we call O-two essential support staff visas. That means they do not support me being able to do an application for the people that work closely with you to do projects in the United States. However, if I can place you in the O-one B visa, we can apply for up to twenty five of your employees and contractors that work with you at a time. that's why it's important for me as a talent agency to make a partnership with you because we can make a lot of lot of revenue difference and access in the united states working together under this project so what I'd like for you to do is take a look at our website see what we're about reach out to me and let's have a conversation so I can get deeper into how this partnership can make a difference in both of our lives, the lives of your employees, the lives of mine, and the family members also. So again, my name is Sherrod Seward of Innovative Global Talent Agency, and I want to have a conversation with you about the O-B visa.",,x,,,

My name is Sherrod Seward. I'm the managing director of Innovative Global Talent Agency. I'd like to officially congratulate you on being selected as a great candidate for our talent pool. What does that mean? That means that we think that you are a great candidate for an O-one visa to come to United States. And we think that once you have that O-one visa, we'll be successful in placing you with one of the best companies in the United States that's looking for people that have your skill set. To back it up, me, prior to starting Innovative Global Talent Agency, ran one of the best O-One Visa law firms in the nation. After doing the operations to moving operations to Florida, I decided to get into a talent agency to help employers solve problems that they can't do with the H-One B visa. Most of you that are being picked probably know what an H-One B visa is, and you know that only eighteen percent of the new ones are approved every year. And that's where we come in. We use our worldwide renowned knowledge in the O-one category to solve this problem. And we solve it by one, picking candidates like you that we think are one of the best in the world at what you do. And number two, we keep great relationships with the top employers in the United States that have issues with visas or do not even want to deal with the visas. What we do is we take the employer out of that and we deal with you directly to get the visa that you need to come to the United States on O-one visas and provide placement services to get you great opportunities. So as a next step, we just need to confirm your eligibility for the O-one. So please use the link provided to put down your information so our attorneys can confirm that you're a great candidate and move you on to the next step of the process.",,,,,

The about the services, how it's bleeding in. We got to get rid of that. We got to we got to change that up. So it looks like this. know the headings right because it just looks kind of messy with it being kind of jumbled in like here so I'm going to go page by page so we're going to go block by block um so here where it says bringing the world's best talent to your doorstep I want this to be a header um The world's best talent ready for hire. World's best talent ready for hire. All right. So now we go to the executive summary. Replace this video with this one. So that's John Lee. I'm not going to spell it right. I'm going kind of quick. All right. And then I want the words replaced with this. Now we're going to scroll down under the pitch deck, right? Under the pitch deck, I want some pictures of news press that I've done. So basically to kind of highlight where we've been placed in news articles. So like this news coverage. You see how this picture's here? Something like that there. Like this, like these pictures. something like that. I want that to be right in here, pictures like this. And that's where the new words go. Now let's go back to this part. The next block is proven talent. So just like in a pitch deck where I'm asking for there to be like a lot of logos, I want the logos to be featured here as they are on the homepage. All these logos, it's just being able to toggle. So it'll say, they'll have the video, then it'll say model proven Visa Secure talent placed. Well, I guess it says it twice. And they'll have logos of these companies and it should look like... should look like this but try to have them with black logos with white letters so they can all kind of look the same because this looks kind of ghetto honestly it's a good effort but it should if they're all black it looks much better then this is a little rush so I want this change and I want that same carousel with all those logos that I said that I showed you right here, I want those on there and just be able to toggle through them. And that goes, and these are in order. So this goes before market opportunity. Next is the market opportunity. So I'll put this here. All right, so next we go to market opportunity. there's a video now I don't want these videos in drop down I want them to be like looking like this so content video image content video image well this one will be like the the block but then if there's like a cut a video image that's how I want it so this is uh and france of course you'll put the youtube thing in there So next will be market opportunity. You'll get rid of this, get rid of this subscription service. All right. So I want this part gone and said, I want it replaced with this market opportunity and video. So that's where it says, get rid of that. Now, after that, you'll have the investment, the investment explanation. There's a video for this too. Like, generally, you can sort it right. Sorry, I'm moving fast. I can't really see what I'm typing. All right, so I want, like, package one on one side, package two on the other side, and then the minimum return can be under both. Block. I want why our process is better. Make sure to get the capitalizations right. And then just use... I forgot to do a video from that. So make a space for a video. I forgot that one. Placeholder. The next block, get rid of this. Get rid of that. Only have this part. This part you can get rid of. Get rid of this. So you'll keep this part. Do I have a problem statement? I don't have a problem statement like that. So you can get rid of this. Get rid of this. This will be why our process is better. Get rid of this part. But keep this part. You can get rid of this part. Business model, get rid of, only include the retainer fees. So in the business model, I want you to get rid of the subscription part, but do keep this part. Get rid of this. Then in market strategy, I rewrote, I rewrote the points for that. Oh, I mean, before you get to market strategy, there's a part that says team in place. So you wanna definitely put that in there. And there's a video for that part. Team in place. Video on top. A market strategy. So I rewrote the like tabs and there should be a video here. Let me go get it. Well, I'll put it in there afterwards. I'll put the video in there afterwards. And then that will be the end of this. And we'll be we'll be ready to go.

For example, for a past year, we've been gathering the contact information for the best AI, the best computer scientists and award-winning mechanical engineers in the world. We've already assembled the clientele of who files for H-1B visas and gets a lot of denials. We already have relationships with the best H-1B attorneys in the nation that file hundreds of these per year and know them personally and will lean on them for warm introductions. And finally, we have a publicist that's very good at placing us in strategic places to gain credibility. And then also we have me unleash to where me and my sales team can call on both partners, talent and our clients directly to get stuff done in a way we couldn't do with the law firm.

Now going down to the rest of the team is we have a very seasoned university director, and that will be the person in charge of setting up partnerships with universities all across the world to get access to their PhD level students and also their student athletes as we can do placements with athletes and coaches as well. We do have a publicist. Our publicist was the publicist for the UFC Ultimate Fighting Championships when they first were coming to rise, and most recently at one fighting championships where she was with one of the second biggest mixed martial arts promotion in the world. She's already involved heavily in getting us placements around the world to help spread the credibility of Innovative Global Talent Agency and highlight the success stories that we have already. In addition to this, we also have two junior talent acquisition staff that are placed strategically in India and Bangladesh. We have two marketing persons, one that's here that is MIT trained at the master's level in digital marketing, and we have one in the Philippines that's been trained out there. We have a tech development coordinator. This is a person that went to school at NCAT and their engineering computer science program. And they're responsible for helping making sure that we know that the talent we are getting on the tech side is indeed very special. Just because I know and I can see somebody has some good accolades online, we do wanna make sure on the back end that they are as special as we think they are. We also have a law firm partner. For the past two years, I have been training a mentor of mine to take over the operations of the law firm while keeping the knowledge base and excellence that we keep with our special sauce of how we get things done. So we have a full law firm partnership that we have excellent pricing and relationship with that is filled with my knowledge base. And second, we have two direct sales persons that are personally trained by me, one in the great nation of Belize and another in the Philippines so that we can cover both time zones across the world as we try to get this business.",,,,,

You are investing in people, candidates, and then participating in the return of those candidates. That's why we have two packages, and both of these reflect premium processing applications, meaning that we can get the visas done very quickly, and most of it covers government fees. So the first package is that you can sponsor two candidates for $15,000. What we do with those candidates is we'll get them the visa and then we'll present them for placement. And the reason why the return has such a big influx of what it can be on the minimum end versus the maximum end, it depends on how high the salary is that we placed them. So we like to give realistic expectations. We are not willing to place anybody in a job that's under $70,000. So at $70,000, your minimum return will be $42,000. And then even in the by chance that we did something under that, we will always give a return of at least 100% of what you put in once we do like a placement. On the higher end, if we're doing high-end individuals that have really big skill sets or even C-suite skill sets, they can be getting paid $350,000 for their job, first year salary placement. And so that's how you can get up to $210,000 just off of two candidates. The next package that we have is that you can do a 30,000 investment for five candidates. And that's just doing the math up from there so that your minimum return on a $70,000 salary is looking at 105,000. So you would come back with 60,000 of revenue. And on the high end, if we place five people at jobs of 350,000 each, then your return can get up to as much as $183,000. And who knows, maybe even more. The way the timeline works on the investment is it takes us about two months at the high end to get the visa done. And then from there, once they're placed, employers usually pay out 45 days after they felt the employee out to see if there was a match or not. In the case that somebody doesn't match and there's something not there, we can immediately put this person back into the talent pool the way we struck the visas that they're immediately available for another opportunity. You know, so it might be the case that you might get paid off multiple times after an employee. If it's the case that they do their 45 days and then maybe four months down the line, they decide that they want to change. We're still earned our fees, but that talent, that person is placed back in a talent pool with a visa that's ready to go. So that particular candidate can particularly go again. And you would again share in that revenue with them and be in business with us. So while there are these two packages, you can get as many packages as you want. So if you want to do the $30,000 package more than once, then you can just raise your candidates. For example, $90,000 will get you 15 candidates at that same rate and so forth. So I think the business model is very clear. And we present the candidates to you, especially if you're in that industry, and tell you why we think that they are great candidates for the visa and why it would be very, very likely that they'll get placed for a high revenue yield with an employer sooner than later.",,,,,

It's so vast, especially if this problem is solved. And I'll tell you why. We do know that there are 500,000 H-1B applications each year, of which only 18% go through. And that's because there's a cap issue. There's only 85,000 of those available. Now, if we take those eight rejections, which are around 400,000 of them, and we look at just 3% of those, and we're able to get that talent, and of that, do maybe 10% of that 3% rejection, we're looking at a potential market value of replacing those in the category that I know of almost $70 million on that placement. And that's just from companies that are trying to apply for visas and doesn't include the ones that are not trying at all because they don't want to deal with the process. In addition, we know that there are 13,000 PhD level candidates that graduate each year in STEM majors in the United States. Looking at even just a small percentage, five percentage points of being able to place those individuals, would yield an almost $30 million market value on placing those candidates. And that doesn't even include just worldwide talent out there in the talent pool that have a visa issue or have a miscommunication with their employer that doesn't want to participate in the issue. we take care of that issue for them. And that means the reasonably $70 million market share of the H-1B rejections, that can mean the $30 million market value, and just 3% of the graduating class of PhD students that are foreign nationals in STEM programs. And then that doesn't even include the worldwide global talent out there that would love to get to United States. The opportunity is vast.",,,,,

But I've had the fortunate and unfortunate experience of being able to do a unique set of things in my time practicing sports immigration law for the past six, seven years. Some of those include being one of the only private attorneys to place companies during COVID-19 on the presidential exemption as with companies along like the NFL, NBA, UFC. And another one of those is winning in federal court with a lawsuit against Homeland Security that's based on the itinerary issue when it comes to getting visas. Long story short, that means can you get visas that are not associated directly with the employer? And the answer was yes. And we've used this in a variety of situations. I use it all the time with fighters that are assigned to managers. I've done it in the NFL with players that are not currently signed to NFL teams and have them play on multiple teams on the same visa with the same structure we're proposing here. I've had it done in an NBA G League. where I've had independent players before they're draft eligible get the same visa that we're putting under these employees and have them play for the g league ignite it's something that's tried proven and we have done dozens hundreds of times it's just now instead of doing it in sports we're bringing it to more day-to-day uh type of industries that will also be honestly more lucrative for both myself and for you you",,,,,

First of all, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to look at this pitch deck. It's something that's very important to me. And I know that it takes advantage of all the skill sets that I've learned in my professional life. The foremost of so is I am one of the best attorneys in the nation when it comes to extraordinary ability visas. These are the visas that I've done at the very top level from boxing matches on ESPN, to Olympic trials, to cricket leagues, to mind readers, and finally to business executives, AI professionals, data scientists, and other persons that have a high, high value when it comes to being employed in the United States. Each year, United States employers file for half a million H1B visas, of which there are only 85,000 available. And there's even more employers that would like to try to get foreign talent, but don't even want to deal with the visa process because it's just so awful. That's why I decided to step out of the law firm and put on the hat of the client. There's a reason why people paid us so much to get birth visas. It's because it's so lucrative on the back end to have in place with employers. So that's what Innovative Global Talent Agency does. It takes advantage of my years of experience in getting visas before job employment and make that available in the everyday course of Fortune 3000 business is going to completely change the game for them. They will not have to lift a finger to get the best talent in the world hired at their doorstep. So I look forward to presenting this idea to you. Thank you very much.",,,,,

I'll go ahead and share my screen for you. I see that you're here on a B-I, B-II visa, and I am doing an evaluation for you. I hope that this is you right here. If so, that means you're pretty seasoned. So if this is you and you're born in then I'm guessing that you're not still competing at the highest levels. If you are, then the P-one would be appropriate. But if not, let's see if we can see where your last rates are. So let's go to nine, two, and sixty. Oops. So when was this? So what would be more appropriate for you is the O-one visa if you're not indeed still competing. It's not a problem, but you just can't do the P-one visa if you're not still competing. It looks like we have some from two thousand eleven. But that's not going to be recent enough to get the P-one, but it is suitable for you to do the O-one visa. And what we'll need to do for the O-One visa is basically show an itinerary, maybe that you are still coaching other athletes, making content, things of that nature. If you do not have a petitioner in the United States, our talent agency that we work with can do that for you. for a cost and what they'll do is be the signers off on your paperwork and then also even actively look for opportunities for you to participate in in the United States to fulfill your itinerary requirements. But yes, for you, it looks like the P-one visa is not appropriate and it would be the O-one visa that would work out for you. And I hope this was helpful and thank you very much.",,,,,

Previous to that, I was a immigration attorney that ran a practice exclusively focused on O1, P1, and EB1A visas. And we did unique structures that we learned from doing a lot of sports, especially independent sports like combat, where we can learn how to do visas where employers, in this case it would have been promoters, do not have to be involved at all. We are very aware of the challenges that are faced in H-1Bs, cap issues, and just employers not want to be involved in the visa process at all, even when it comes to practical things like answering questions all the time about when am I going to get my green card? Where's this? Where's that? And that's where innovative immigration, I mean, sorry, innovative global talent agency comes in to take that off of employers' hands. We work with our O-1 visa law firm that used to be mine to secure O-1 visas, O-2 visas ahead of time and work with our employers so that The employer does not have to be involved in the visa process at all. That means you do not have to file for any visas. You do not have to speak to clients about the visas and you do not have to eventually sponsor green cards if you do not wish to. We take care of that. And so what I'm looking to do is introduce this concept to you. of how we do the structure so you can be more comfortable with it. We want to talk to you about any H-1B casualties that you might have. You might have some talent that you are interested in, but just do not want to even look into the visa process. Allow us to do that for you. So please, Take the time to schedule a consultation to speak to myself, Sherrod Seward, or one of the directors here at the agency to learn how we do this unique approach to help make life easy for you.

And it went to where we started doing visas for executives. And then from there, we started doing the same visas for internationally recognized startups and highly skilled employees. And what I'm contacting you about is with the talent agency, we have a great need to partner with someone like yourself that is both highly skilled at your profession and also has a big following in your network. And that's so we can take advantage of the O-1B visa to make quite a bit of money together, honestly bringing talent to the United States. What we do is we are one of the only firms recruiting agencies that specializes in obtaining visas for the best minds in the world and the best agencies in the world and making them pre-authorized with work authorization to do projects in the United States. So the best case scenario is that we can partner with you as an executive to get an O1B visa, and then we can get the individuals that you work with O2 visas to be immediately available for projects in the United States. On the state side, we are connecting with the premier employers and projects to let them know that we have talent that is on the way. And so I'm hoping that you will see this and see the opportunity in this and partnering with us for allowing us to get you a visa in O1B category and work together as organizations to take advantage of the work shortage here in the United States.

"July.17,2024",How the O-1 Visa can help international private wealth clients - Talent Based Migration,Business Development or Marketing,How the O-1 Visa can help international private wealth clients - Talent Based Migration,How the O-1 Visa can help international private wealth clients - Talent Based Migration.mp4,How the O-1 Visa can help international private wealth clients - Talent Based Migration.mp3,"Hello, my name is Attorney Sherrod Seward, and I am an immigration attorney by trade and the managing director of Innovative Global Talent Agency. Today, I'm discussing how global citizens and private wealth clients around the world can leverage both non-immigrant and immigrant talent-based options to obtain access to the United States market, even if you don't want to live in the United States permanently. As we know, with uncertainty around the world with different conflicts and different economic stressors, there's a lot of currency value that's going up and down. So people might find themselves in a country where they're used to a certain amount of wealth, uh, meaning a certain run of things globally, but due to currency fluctuations, the value of their net worth is going down drastically. And there's a need to put the money in different types of jurisdictions that might be less, less volatile and more stable. One of those is, of course, the United States, where the dollar is very strong and very stable. A lot of clients come and ask us, well, how can we take advantage of that without necessarily having to move there on a permanent basis before we're ready? And what we do is we help facilitate these opportunities through the O-1 visa structure. Typically, when private wealth level clients want to come to the United States, they look at the EB-5 investment program. which involves at least an $800,000 investment and up to more than a million to come to the United States. And it takes a while and it's permanent residence, which means you have to stay in the United States for a certain amount of time, which usually invokes a personal income tax here in the United States. But what a lot of people in this position do not know is that you can use the 01 non-immigrant visa option, which is a visa for international people with extraordinary abilities in business, in the arts, and pretty much any industry. And you can use that to come here on a non-immigrant basis for three years, be able to open multiple businesses, multiple bank accounts, and pretty much if it's structured properly, do your business the same that you would do if you had work authorization under a green card. The thing that's different is that there's no requirement to stay in the United States for a certain amount of days per year on the O-1 visa, which means that you probably will not incur the personal income tax by staying here longer than six months if you do not want to. You can come in a couple of days a year, you can come in a couple of months a year, whatever is comfortable for you. And then if you do decide that you want to stay in the United States permanently, there's the opportunity to file for an EB-1A. which is a self-sponsored immigrant visa, comes with a green card, that is not tied to investment. It's tied to your talent-based acumen. Here at the law firm we associate with an international global talent agency, We work with lawyers that pretty much exclusively only operate in talent-based situations. So we're able to articulate arguments for individuals that are entrepreneurs, business owners, highly skilled professionals in a way that's more nuanced than attorneys that might be more general in their practice. It does come up to say, well, we need a petitioner. If you're doing the O1A, you do need a petitioner to sign off on your visa work, but when it's structured properly, they do not have to be terribly involved and your day-to-day activity if it's structured properly. And that's where Innovative Global Talent Agency comes in. We can serve as a petitioner partner for your O-1 visa and talk to you and work with you through your projects to get your itinerary together so that you will have the flexibility to do the projects that you want, open the businesses you want on the same visa, while knowing that USCIS knows you have an itinerary that will last you to three years. just by doing projects with the Innovative Global Talent Agency in a manner that's mutual beneficial for both parties. So I hope that this was informative to you. And do not forget about talent-based immigration. It could save you a lot of headaches and offer a lot of flexibility. Thank you very much.",,,,,

The straightforward answer is no, because you cannot have full control over an entity that serves as your petitioner. There needs to be an independent entity to receive service of process. One way around that is at our innovative global talent agency, where we have a petitioner service and from our previous experience in immigration law, we know how to properly structure and use this service to not get in tied up with giving up control of your company. when you're doing a startup in the United States under the 01A or 01B. And how we do that is by using the agent functioning as the employer or the US agent for multiple employers arrangement. So how this works is Innovative Global Talent Agency will serve as the petitioner for the visa, but either structure it so that the Petitioner is an agent for multiple employers or projects that you have going on for the founder already. Or we do it as US agent navigating and directing the activities of the beneficiary founder. And the way that works is we would make some in-kind service that the founder's business would do on behalf of the talent agency and try to make that as de minimis as possible. And then also list some of the activities that the founder tends on doing, including doing for their own business while they're there. This way, the founder will be able to use a petitioner service that will stay completely, you know, pretty much out of their business, except for when it's advantageous to them. And also they would be able to pretty much do their business without having a board if they don't want to, or having to give up over 51% control in their company here to satisfy that control element when it comes to who is the petitioner. So we're going to go out, spread the word to both founders and immigration attorneys that work in the space to show them that there's another way and you can keep control with IGTA. Thank you very much.",,x,,,

By trade, I'm an immigration attorney, but I'm reaching out to you as an HBCU alumnus of Hampton University and managing director of Innovative Global Talent Agencies. In my previous career as an immigration attorney, I ran a law firm where we did a lot of visas for some of the premier athletes in the world, ranging from world champions such as Canelo Alvarez to Tyson Fury to full-grown sports leagues such as US Master T10 Crickets. And we've also done visas for a lot of student athletes such as track athletes that are graduating from school and even NFL and NBA players that have graduated and went on to play in the professional leagues. I'm reaching out to you for one to introduce myself and then also introduce my business, Innovative Local Talent Agency. There's a number of ways we can be very, very valuable to both your student body and faculty. For one, what we do is we sponsor visas and find opportunities for our clients. So the main thing that we do that's different is we get the visa first. So we use our knowledge base, N01s, P1s, and EB visas to obtain work authorization for either students or even faculty, and I'll explain in a minute why that can be important, is we obtain work authorization through our talent agency, which serves as the petitioner, and we can work with our partners that are subscribed to us to make those talents immediately available. So for students, we are helpful to athletes that are looking to continue competing in the United States or training after they graduate. We're useful to highly skilled professional students who might have trouble getting a job that sponsors them. We, especially at the doctorate and postgraduate master's level in certain STEM industries, can get visas that are basically placed with us. And then we have agreements with certain companies that anybody that has a visa with us automatically has work authorization with them as well. And another thing we do is we help universities be more competitive when it comes to recruiting international faculty. We know that the H-1B program can be challenging. So what we do is we get faculty on O-1 visas placed with us and then have them contracted out or hired full time as you would do with a normal recruiting agency at the university. And we hope that this message has reached you in good spirits, and we hope to be of help in the future. But either way, I'd like to have a conversation with you to introduce myself and explore how we can help your HBCU grow. Thank you very much.",,,,,

And if you look at advanced search, so if I rank and put top 500, okay. Without titles. Let's try this. So we start getting all these. Right here. And what we're going to do is start messaging. Messaging them so. Let me make this right here. And I'm going to message them from Innovative Global Talent Agency right here. And then I'll go ahead and put the message we're going to send over here. And let me go grab it. Just grabbing the message that we're going to send to them. Hopefully have you call them back. Right. I got to refresh something real quick. All right. So let's make a new one. All right, so now we have the message. Any part is like we want to take care of the visas. So let's start sending some messages. The ones we might want to look for are people that have tried quite a bit for visas, but didn't get them. Right, so this number is H-1Bs to LCAs. So I think this is the visas that they got compared to the visas that they filed for. So this one, they applied for a lot of them, and they just didn't get them. so I'll do this I get here and we'll message him now I expect you to go and like put these like on a list somewhere so we don't double our efforts but because you can see which ones I'm sending it to And then I'm copying the message and copying you. All right, that should work. And what I'll also do is follow on LinkedIn. Next, send a message. Hello. Bam. So that's a large employer. Next, let's go look for a smaller one just so we have about 10 of these. I'm going to tell you what. So I'm going to go down more and be viewed more towards the bottom of the list just to get some people that may be filed for visas but didn't really get them. Yeah, like let's try a university. I'm doing this because I'm just trying to get some variety going. Because we don't know who's going to be our sweet spot. But this is a job all in itself. But ideally, it'd be more nuanced than this. But you can see they can be called after this. And of course, I am going to. Follow her. on LinkedIn as well. All right. Let's get back to it. Now let's go see if we can find an AI company. Let's go back to the back, all the way back here. Imperial Group Manufacturing. Robotics Corp. Director of Angie Hendricks Iron Forum. But you see, there's no shortage of potential customers here. We just need to do our job to get the word out. So what was her name again? Angie Hendricks for Imperial Group. Also. What? Let's do there too. OK. Lebanon. Let's go search some more. Let's talk about what we do in cruisers company. Construction company. Interesting. Leticia. So this is somebody that's doing some of their own. Prime up. So whenever I kind of like email, tag you on somebody, I'm like relying on you to follow up. Because they're probably not going to say what's up to the first one. So this guy is the CEO, Navit. Oh, what's the name of the company? I forgot, that quick, Atisian. But it doesn't appear to be on LinkedIn. That's cool. So let's go back up and pick another random one. Smith Group. Enter crisis, psoriasis. See if she's on LinkedIn. Okay. Let's go for another one. This one I'm just kind of... Embry... So the university, they don't pay very much. About 30% of that would be like 12. A lot of engineering stuff though. Who knows? I probably don't get contacted a lot. But I don't like that these prices are in the ground. I'm going to follow up with LinkedIn on this one. Uh-oh. ideally these would be personalized to them because like when you don't personalize them send too much it spams for sure so we'll do four more go back down this way that's all corporate I don't like those salaries at all. We don't want no cheapos. We want to do an $80,000 and up. This is what I like to see. What is this? Software engineer. Hmm. Yeah, I like that. Amy Grubb. Let's add her phone numbers there so we can call her. Oh, I forgot to tag you. Crystal Lady's gone. So now we're looking for Amy Grubb. What are those called? Smith Group. and find her. No worries. So let's do three more. Let's get one from down here. Senior immigration specialists. That would be both of them. okay photo two more report mcmillan human resource leader I don't know three more let's go this way Sprint trade. He's a general counsel. So this could be, we'd rather not send it straight to the lawyers, but we'll see. Could work out. Could work out bad. Should get bad. It doesn't really matter. We need business, so we're going to find out. Okay, so two more. DiCastro. North America. Let's punch for it and go through. I'm moving pretty fast, so I'll do three more of this one. Counting this, so two more after this. See if we can find her. Susie Ortiz, PDF.com. Sounds important, PDF.com. I'm forgetting to copy on these. No matter. There's a lot of them. OK. This will come up on LinkedIn. Excuse Ortiz PDF solutions. Which is only 10 doesn't look like it's funny if you can find some AI person. Loomis Technologies. Of this robotics one. Flexive robotics. That'll be it for this. See if we can find them on LinkedIn. Flexive. Looks like she's somewhere else. We'll get one more. All right. Oh, we like the salaries. Basil Stewart. No, you know what I want? Why don't you look for every HBCU University in there. I'm gonna do that next. Basil Stewart. A lot of Postmaster stuff in here.

I am reaching out to you as managing director of Innovative Global Talent Agency. I'll bring that to the screen. And what we do at Innovative Global Talent Agency is we leverage our knowledge of these talent-based migration options to obtain visas in advance for some of the most powerful minds and industries that are highly coveted in the United States. And we obtain visas for them in a manner where their ultimate employer is not involved. Meaning, we know how to use the O-1 visa category from our years of experience in doing this in various industries to structure it to where we obtain the visas on behalf of our talent pool candidates and then immediately have them available for project contract and also full time employment with our employer partners. And at this level, this is usually executive level or right below that for some tremendously lucrative and interesting opportunities. We look to obtain visas not only for the candidate being hired, but also the family members, spouse and children under 21 under the O3 category. And we can also many times obtain visas for support staff or persons that have worked with you on important projects or highly talented pupils that study under your tremendous program. Even if you're not interested directly or immediately working in the United States, participating in the talent pool does help remain that option open. So that way you would never have to worry about having a new visa to take advantage of that opportunity should it come up. It would be automatically available with work authorization. Furthermore, under you, if you're able to obtain essential support staff visas, you could always send your pupils and your stead to the United States to help work on projects that you're selected for. So I just want to tell you congratulations for being selected to our international talent pool. And we'd like you to continue the next step by filling out an application sheet so that we confirm that you are a great candidate for O1 and in turn a great candidate to work with our employer partners.

"July.16,2024",O-1 versus EB-1A for Cricket Professional,Immigration Sports,O-1 versus EB-1A for Cricket Professional,O-1 versus EB-1A for Cricket Professional.mp4,O-1 versus EB-1A for Cricket Professional.mp3,"Hello, this is attorney Sherrod Seward, and I am responding to an inquiry about whether they get an EB-1A or O-1 for a cricket professional. The person is currently in the United States under a B-1 visa with two months in, so they have four months left to go there, and they would like to be able to work, but not necessarily in cricket when they come. So the first thing that we look at is the background. When we're dealing with athletics and O1s and EV1As, a lot of time national team experience is very, very important. So here we see that they have been a captain on the U19 team, and they have played with the Pakistan international team for quite a few years. And then what we like too is that they played and coached overseas. all the way up to 2020 and still is currently doing the consultations. Now that's great because we can use both the athletic and the coaching experience in that. And it actually makes it a little bit better to say like, Hey, this is a cricket professional in this thing, rather than just an athlete, because that would make the eligibility requirement much higher. But We're looking at eligibility with this type of background. One, the national team has pretty much guaranteed that we can get an O-1 visa. And then when you add the coaching prowess, that's when we can get into a better case for the EB-1A. Now, which one is better? In this case, if they are looking to work in something other than cricket, then the EB1A is going to be more applicable because then he and his spouse can get the work authorization that's blanket. It's not put towards just one case. I mean, one type of industry. However, if they're looking to get it faster, then doing the O-1 with a petitioner service, because in this case, they do not have a petitioner to work with in the United States, would be more advantageous because you can get that done in probably two months. But with this background, we're very, very confident in the EB-1A. Now, what we would say is to do the EB-1A with premium processing so that you can get a quick decision. Now, if that decision happens to be adverse, then maybe the alternative would be to file the 01 then we should probably be at a much reduced rate because we already have all the arguments we needed for the 01 and it pretty much just be paying for the petitioner service and an hourly fee for redoing the arguments and the forms and the filing fee. So that is how we approach this situation that comes up a lot on whether they should do the ev1a or o1 first you look to see what you're eligible for here this cricket professional from their athletics and their coaching is a great candidate for both then you look to see what are you looking to do united states are you looking to work in cricket if not then the ev1a with the work authorization that comes through adjusting status is better, especially if you want the spouse to be able to work too, because we can file all those at once. And then you look at timing. If you have the time to wait for advanced parole in the United States, or if you have business that you need to wrap up in your home country, then you can do the EB-1A and look at the consular processing options as far as interview times or priority dates when it's done. But either way, this is a great candidate and we're glad to hit us up. And I hope this helped educate the people out there about O1s versus EB1As and which one makes more sense for you.",,,,,

This is attorney Sherrod Seward, sports immigration lawyer, where I talk about a lot of common issues I see, especially a lot in combat sports. And today I'm talking about a common issue that we get from MMA and boxing managers, but particular with ones that have athletes that fight in the UFC. Typically, when international athletes fight in the UFC, they get a P1 visa. Sometimes they get P1 visas for multiple years, but a lot of times they get visas for single events. And that can be very problematic for athletes, especially ones that train in the United States and don't just come here to fight. So we had one inquiry from a fighter, a UFC fighter that lives in the United States. They have children. and a spouse in the United States, but they're currently stuck in another country because they do not have a P1 visa to come back to the United States. And they're not in a country where they have ESTA visa waivers. So pretty much they were expecting to fight in Las Vegas, which of course a P1 would be issued. But since their fight was moved to another country, they were unable to convince the promotion to get them a P1. So we're asked what can be done about that? Well, there is something that can be done, which is called a concurrent P1 or just having your own P1 anyway. You do not have to have your P1 filed by the UFC or Zufa to compete there. We have plenty, maybe even dozens of experiences where We have a third party that files for the P1 visa using the itinerary of the USC, especially if they're already signed, and getting a multi-year visa that they have and can control, which they can use to, even if they get cut, still have the visa in place if they get cut from the UFC. And they can also use that visa to get support staff persons on their own without having to wait for the UFC. So for the the managers out there that are wondering why does it make sense to obtain your own visa apart from the promoter is because you have that flexibility of knowing, one, I have a visa in place for multiple years, regardless of my contractual status. And two, while I do have a promotional contract about agreement with a big promoter, that's the best time, the easiest time to get successful results on that visa application. So this is just out there to put as informational use for those that could use it. And have a great day.",,,,,

This video right here is just a short introduction to the longer one you'll see when you look at the actual pitch deck. What am I trying to do? I am trying to disrupt the $200 billion talent industry, which is expected to grow to 1 trillion by 2029 by using my visa expertise that I've been working on for the past five years. Currently, most foreign talent that works in the United States does so under the H-1B, which has a cap of 85,000 applications, new ones. And there is a market demand of 500,000 or more per year. And that excludes the companies that just do not want to deal with this at all. What I do is use the visa knowledge that I've had over the past five years working with world championship athletes all the way to their executives to take employers completely out of the visa process and have it so the best talent around the world, which we have identified already, and key industries can get visas and be ready to go for employers next day, just like anyone else. And when they make those placements, it's very lucrative. What I need is talent. I'm trying to raise seed money so I can have the filing fees to have a vast portfolio of these candidates, which makes it easier for me to go get contracts with big agencies, big companies, things of that nature. It's hard to do that with two, 10, or 20, but it's a much easier conversation to have when you have 50, 60 applicants ready to go immediately. So I appreciate your attention to the pitch deck, and I'm ready to make some money. I'm hungry. Let's get it, and I hope you invest with me. Thank you.",,,,,

I need to make sure he's doing that. And then putting ones that make sense on this list, the sheet right here. You know what I mean? Now, so I'll send you the link for this sheet. And what you do is just look for roof repairs. Like for example, July, this one was due roof repair. So you should probably take it off. And then this, this is the link to the actual bid. So you can go open it up. And then all the information for the bid will be right here. Please note, no telephone calls during this announcement. Right? So, but a lot of times when you go to the bid, let's see, for a cemetery, for example, like we'll go to the cemetery. Get out of here. Get out of here. You can open the bid. But also, you can open this drive link. Get out of here. That'll have the documents that go with it. So you can just open this up. And then like scroll through it. And this one's in North. Oh, man, this one's in North Carolina. Yeah, this one was in North Carolina. Yeah, so. looks like for some site preparation or whatever and just do your thing so then you look at it you decide if you could do it and just send an email back and say like you know or call me said like hey yeah I shared I can do it and send a document with your pricing and stuff like that and copy jibo which I'll send you his information and he'll put that into the sheet all right And so that's basically how we have to do it for now is just go to this contract list, look for the ones that are for like roofing and stuff like that. There might be a whole bunch of them. And see if it's something you can bid on. Let me know what it will cost for you. We could put a little markup. And then the next step is like, well, collectively, we have to figure out how to submit the bids. But that's how it works. So I just need to get you this link and the email to Jibo. Peace.",,,,,

"July.11,2024",Gaganpreet,Client Correspondence,Gaganpreet,Gaganpreet.mp4,Gaganpreet.mp3,"Hello, this is Sherrod Seward, Sherrod Sports Visas, and a message for Mr. Gaggenpreet. I see that you have a couple of questions for your P-One extension. Let's get into it. I also left you a message by phone. First, will you extend the visa for five years? We do not advise that because that will invite increased scrutiny from USCIS. The best practice is to go for three years right now because they will adjudicate five years much more strictly. Can you work on a P-one visa? You can do boxing related activities on the P-one visas and things for sponsorships. You cannot drive trucks. You cannot do things like work as a bank teller, things of that nature. If you have a sponsor that's in a particular field and you do stuff for them here and there and make it like a marketing thing, that is not as bad as an idea as of just working in a completely different field. Can I take admission in any university for a master's degree? Yes, you can. You can absolutely go to school full time. And matter of fact, if you get that master's degree, you can look at doing a green card based on a national interest waiver, EB-II national interest waiver, assuming that computer science is still needed in the United States and a great deal in two years when you graduate. Can I change my visa category so I can perform these tasks? No, you can't. In your estimation, where you're at, I think that the P-I is the best category that you can do right now, and I would stay right there and not pursue the O-I visa. But like I said, you can go to school and then maybe do the EB-II national interest waiver in a few years. I hope this serves you well, and I'll have the team resend the invoice and everything to get started. Thank you.",,,,,
"July.10,2024",IGTA - Pitch - Sherrod Seward_ Esq_,Business Development or Marketing,IGTA - Pitch - Sherrod Seward_ Esq_,IGTA - Pitch - Sherrod Seward_ Esq_.mp4,IGTA - Pitch - Sherrod Seward_ Esq_.mp3,"Hello, how's it going? First, I appreciate your attention to this. This is very important to me and something I'm very excited about. And I think it's a combination of all my skill sets that I've developed over the past. I don't know. I've been out of school for almost 20 years now, but I've learned a lot of important things. But this is the one that's going to make a lot of money. This idea came to me because, as most people know, I was running an immigration law firm. And my immigration law firm focused on extraordinary ability of visas, which means visas for the top tier crust of talent in the world, which started off as sports, but then went on to other things, including just high skilled computer data scientists, professionals, things of that nature, and executives. And what I determined to do was I'm going to become my law firm's biggest client. There's a reason why all of these companies hire immigration attorneys to bring in talent from all over the world. And that's because a lot of the best talent is all over the world. And it takes visas to get them here to work. James Moore- Fortunately, for me, and now for you I'm one of the best at the nation at getting a one visas and that allows me a certain type of advantage when it comes to making a recruiting agency, based on that top crest of talent compared to others, let me share my screen and get into it. James Moore- So. This is the idea, Innovative Global Talent Agency. Typically the way that recruitment industry works is there's a job opening, a recruiter will hire for it and hope to God that the person that they have from it is from the United States because otherwise they'll have to invest money after the candidate has been chosen to then get the visa, hopefully, and then come in. What we do to disrupt this is one is we don't respond to job descriptions. What we do is find the best minds in the world that are game-changing talents and we get them visas all set, ready to go before the employer has to do anything. So as far as the employer is concerned on their day-to-day basis, they don't have to do anything with this visa process. I will not bore you with the nitty-gritty of how we do this, but what I will do is show you how we've been using this in the sports industry to do this for literally hundreds of approvals in P1 and O1 visas, which is the visa category that we use in this, particularly O1s. It's something that we've been doing since the inception of the firm, and we have already had success stories with this. For example, Shivam Arora is a Indian national who was at school, I believe, at MIT, something like that. But we ended up getting him an O-1 visa with our company. And he was placed on Goldman Sachs and some other companies back to back to back because of his skill set and that he had the O-1 visa ready to go, which means two things. It's proven already that we can have one visa and have the same person work on multiple companies. And those companies, even when those that are as conservative as Goldman Sachs will accept this category. Now, to get to the business end of how this works is in the talent agency business. People get paid, depending on how reputable they are, for retainers and they get paid for placements. When we're dealing with the upper echelon of executives and high-skilled professionals, you're talking about executive recruiting. And I took the liberty of going to chat GPT and figuring out what the numbers look like on there. So what we're looking to do as a business model is to start with a subscription service to the businesses that we are supplying talent. That's because on the visa side, it makes it very easy for us to explain to USCIS that the jobs that our talents will be doing are not speculative. because we have a contract and invoices on a monthly basis from our employer partners that say that they are looking for talent in these type of skill sets and they are paying for them so they then uscs can't say that well we are not giving you the visa because we don't think that this job is actually going to happen it's pretty much guaranteed to happen if the employer is paying a subscription service for that thing and then if there needs to be additional evidence usually just takes an email saying from the company yep we're interested in this person uh to get it across the finish line All right. So here is where I was looking at an easy way to explain to you how the revenue side of this works on top of our subscription. So in my head, the way I have it now is that startups will have a $1,000 per month subscription service and then Fortune 3000s and up will have a 10,000 per month subscription service just because it has to be substantial enough to make sense. Now look at this retainer fees. So right here, they're talking about the executive search and high level positions. So the initial retainer is usually 35% of a total fee. And it's not uncommon for executive searches to be a $100,000 search fee to which 30,000 was upfront. So if we're just charging a company $10,000 per month on a subscription basis on something where they're gonna get executive level talent, you can see how much money that they're saving from the retainers. Now, when they go and place things, that's where you start even getting more money to where you can eventually get up to $150,000 or so for the retainer fee on an executive search. And then if it's just like a regular job, you can expect to get 20 to 25% of the first year salary. which even if it's a $70,000 job, you're looking at $14,000 or if it's at 30%, which we'll probably charge on the higher end because we were doing the visa service for them and saving that money, it'll probably be even up to $21,000 on a $70,000 job. But most of the jobs that we're recruiting for or getting talent for will be $150,000 and up, which means that 20% of that is like, 45 or so. Math's not great. 30% would be like 45,000 on that. Is that right? I'm not sure. Math is not my thing. But let me show you how this works. So the main thing I would want to know is who are the potential customers and where are you getting the talent from? I've already explained that I know how to get the visas because I've been doing that for the past four years at a very high clip. And I know that the structure works because I've done it in sports and I have success stories for that in the data science. That's even before I have subscribed people to help me with itinerary issues. So here's where the customers come from. There are, Well, let's get back to this. There's H-1B visas are the typical visa category that employers use when they're bringing in foreign talent because you pretty much just have to have like a college degree and a certain amount of experience to get it. And it's more of a cap thing. So there's 180,000 of these visas available for new ones. And each year there's about a million applicants, which means that there's 800,000 people that were chosen by companies that they deemed were worthy of jobs and they just didn't get it because of the cat. So even right there is 800,000 potential candidates that you can bring back to the employers that already wanted them and then charge a fee for that. but there's also thousands of companies in the United States that will not even deal with the visa process because they do not want to file hundreds of thousands of dollars in H-1B visas and not be able to get them just because of the cap. So customer base, we are already gathering the contact information to the companies around the world. I mean, around the nation that have cap casualties. Right? So these are companies that we know file for visas. We know that they do not get all the visas that they want. And this list is full of thousands of companies. That's just the ones that have even tried to file for visas as opposed to the ones that say we do not want to deal with it at all, which in our case is a great candidate too for us to be a customer because we make sure that the employer has nothing to do with the visa process at all. Next area of business is we have a list of the top 200 attorneys in the nation that file H-1B visas, meaning that they have the top picks of clients that they work with directly, and the lucky one that works with us first will have the opportunity to give us warm introductions instead of me taking their business and giving it to somebody else. so that's why this list ideally I'll be working from the top of it and going down to see which one of these people are going to be my friend why would they do that because they know I'm very good at sales and attorneys can't call on companies directly to go after h1b business but since I'm not an attorney in this since I'm a talent agency I can uh cold call and my company can cold call all day to get in the rooms of these attorneys clients and then when we're in there They know that I know immigration law enough to be dangerous to say like, hey, shared my point, some holes in our business, which might lead us to losing that account. So we might as well be friendly to him and introduce us, introduce him to our clients so that he'll be friendly with us. to which I'm probably going to do. Whoever works with me first out of this list and introduce me to their clients will have my gratitude as in I will not make holes in their business relationships with these companies. If not, I don't owe them anything and we'll see what happens. Now, the next question should be, where do I get my talent? Well, We've already for about a year and a half been growing our database of the best artificial intelligence and data scientists in the world, going by one, influencers, also going by awards, and going by competition. So far, our contact list is around 3,000 people. of which we consider all of them to be great candidates for all o1 visas and highly sought off their talents by the companies that would be in this list so what we do is we contact them we tell them that we'll get them a free visa and promote them to the companies in the united states that they want to work with and that's where the investment comes in The filing fees, well, I'll put it like this. Getting a visa done under regular processing takes about four to six months and will cost $2,500. Under premium processing, we get decisions 15 business days or less about whether the visa is approved or response is needed. And that costs fifty five hundred dollars for per application. So what we're proposing in this investment round is that our investors can sponsor specific candidates, which means they can sponsor candidates at the regular processing clip or at the premium processing clip. and we will present that candidate to them um or a couple candidates and let you pick and we'll pitch why we think this one is a good one as far as getting the visa and also as far as getting picked up quickly by a customer and we'll let the investor choose and sponsor individual candidates and be able to share in the profits of their revenue which we already went to that can get pretty much up there even as much as, you know, $150,000 for executive search type level clients. And even on the lower end, you're looking at, 20 to $30,000 per client. And the way it works on the business end is, of course, we have to get them here. And the companies typically pay, sometimes they pay upfront if it's on the executive level for searching. But that's not really our model. We want them to pay in bulk when the client is actually here. so we'll probably have them pay half once they get here and then half of their fees owed 45 days after the client is I mean after the person is there for 45 days so that's the opportunity one the talent industry is huge there's a huge shortage of high skilled professionals two companies do not like doing visas We know how to take that completely out of their hands. Three, I'm already proven at doing this visa category and have a success story in this industry without even having the subscription service. Four, we know who our clients are. Five, we know which attorneys they work with and we're going to take their business if they don't give us warm introductions. And six, we have already identified 3,000 candidates that we think are great for this program. And we want you to invest in them individually and share in the profits. Hope this pitch deck reached you well, that it's well-comprehended, and that you will consider working with us because I'd rather get started sooner than later. Let's get it.",,,,,

Just made a custom GPT. Annoying, but I think it's going to help us out a lot as far as like getting to the leads. So I'm just going to dial for dollars. Let's get it. Hello. The top ten most promising prospects. So I can call them. Let's give you some clues. It's going a little slower than I would like. Still, it's hopefully faster than just going through the list. While we're waiting, I'm going to call protection. Where is he? Hey, how's it going? Hey, can you hear me? Nothing much. I wanted to just check on you, see how things are going with your brother and all the projects. Okay. Gotcha. Um, so that's August fourth and you're still looking to do the, uh, tournament in, in October. All right. Um, The other question, so I never received the, I'll send it again, but there's a privacy notice that needs to be for your brother to get him the inquiry from the Senator. So I'll forward that again to you. Then the other outstanding thing is we had talked about the other initiative where we were doing the O-one, the same thing we did for Shaji. And we said there's probably a way that we could co-market that and split some fees. I just wanted to see if there was still interest there. I could send you some information. All right. I'll send it to you in a text so you can see how the link is. The easiest way that we see people do it is like if you like it, what we do is we just make you a custom link that just basically has all the information in front of them. So you don't have to spend a lot of time on it. And then if people are interested, they could just fill out their contact information. We would know it came from you and then we can handle the business from there. And this one's contingent. So like, it's like if we're unsuccessful, we just give the legal fees back. Yes, sir. All right. No problem. I will send you that information. Someone's going to log that. My people log. It's okay. Draft is August four. Brother needs privacy notice. Send him link. Right now I need to send him stuff from his brother. Okay, so Ritesh. Privacy notice. Tish privacy notice. Alright, so let's go back to this. Please. be the best prospects from confirmed oral group. It's so much better last time. So we just sent Ritesh everything he needs. Let's hope this goes quickly. I should pull it for myself too. I'm gonna go about twelve. Let's look at good prospects. I was about to say, where they at? Or Juanbo. So let's see. Oops. I have so much money for that. Let's see if he's in here. I can't verify that. Right, so we got some. Original King, let's try him. Hello, speak to Original King, please. This is a shared sports visas. He had called about the visas for the cricket league. I was just looking to see if he still needed them. Yeah. Next year? Okay, no problem. We'll be... Are you ready? Appreciate it. Peace. Let's call this one. This one I'm not calling because there's no phone number. They probably went somewhere else. Telling me what he got. Hello, this is Sherrod Stewart with Sherrod Sports Visas, Innovative Immigration Law. I know that you are interested in getting an O-one visa. I was just following up personally to see if you had any more questions or anything. I know it's been a while since I talked to you directly. But I did want to introduce that we have a partner named Build Your Dreams Cash that does do financing options for immigration related issues. And I was just going to let you know, I was going to send you a link in case you may be interested in that. A lot of people have been using it lately. But either way, have a great day and we look forward to hearing from you soon. Where's the resources at? Should put this in a knowledge base. All right, so let's see what else we have. Oh, let me document that. Embrace text for BYD. Mark that Doosan closed already, so he's not. Hmm. Hmm. Want to get everybody around. Oh. There's a couple thousand right there, because... All right, let's see who else is on the list. Cadence Arthur, shouldn't be one correction email. I don't remember who this is. Sucker's back's wreck. Why did he suspend it? No, because he lost. Did he fight in Russia? That's great. This athlete. As they are OK following. Last fight. Let them know they are still. Great candidate. Cover. Introduce his full payment link. And. It would be from the knowledge base sheet. Okay. don't know okay do this again but change the payment links and invoice to let's do something Thank you. Ah, it's not perfect. The first. I'm going to treat, I'm trying hard. I am trying hard. I'll head over to that. Okay. Address already down. I'll make a note to myself. The chat. It should. Okay. So for us, why? Let's go for Dawes. Who is she? you Hello, this is Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visas. If you have not been made aware, there's been a management change over at the law firm and we see that you need a P-I renewal. So I just wanted to let you know that we'll be texting over updated payment links that reflect the new management. All the previous files we still have and can still make the same arguments. We just made a change to improve process and add more people to the group. So I just want to let you know that we'll be sending over fresh engagement letter and payment link for the Guild law firm. So that way you are not caught blood, signed it by it. But we look forward to working with you on your renewal. Thank you very much. I think it makes sense to have two of these. One to work the list. So it should be. Portals. My text. The one to message the contacts. Want to send? Like it's lagging a little bit. Need to be more patient. What's going on? Let's go with ten, nine, eight, seven, six. plans we left a message here on new payment links to him um I don't know why it keeps doing it. Don't. All right. So this is doing OK. Now we got what we want. Danny Hartwell. No phone. Right. We have to Dari. Mhm. Hello, this is Sherrod Seward. I was calling because you were previously interested in getting an O-one visa for Daria, who we think is a great candidate for the O-one visa. I was just calling you because we have a change of management at the firm and the services are now issued by Gill Law Firm. So I was going to send you the updated payment links and engagement letter, but didn't want to get you blindsided. We just kind of merged up to offer better services and more more people. under the firm. So I just don't want you to be blindsided and I'll send those payment links to you in case you're still interested in proceeding. Thank you very much. Thank you. me oh you you Oh, this way. I don't even know how to say that now. Let's see what this is. Here we go. Burn in here. Thank you. Hello, this is Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visas. I was following up on a message, and I believe you sent your video too, saying that you're interested in EB-I-A, which is great. But I think in your position, the O-I visa, which would be the more appropriate thing to do right now, just to make sure that you have great work authorization and don't really risk too much by going through the EB-I-A too early. Sometimes people do both, but depending on the resources you have available. But yes, we do think you're a great candidate for the O-One. And I just want to let you know that we would be sending you some updated links that reflect the Gill Law Firm, which is the law firm that services the immigration work. Thank you very much. And we'll be sending you a message. As we begin unto the earth. On up on voicemail. In payment engagement letters are attached. Period, they're not gonna pay anything. Give me some more. Okay. All right, let's see what we got. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. Oh, I did it again. Hmm. Eight thousand, see they did it again, nine thousand. Did it again, did it again. That person, Muniz. She got Muniz. That's why I'm over here then. I think that one's worth looking back. It's kind of gone. Let's see, Gregory. They're waiting for two tournaments. Feel the song. So they're waiting on tournaments. All right. So DL is waiting on tournaments. Who's that last person I sent? Tukasayana. Then the golfer must do tournaments. Solhog. Who's doing more? You. I'm going to do a better job of logging these. I'm logging them too well. Ta-da! Hello, this is Sherrod Seward, Innovative Immigration Law. We had previously sent information to you regarding to the EB-A application. While it is a viable option for you, we think that it is much, much easier to do EB-II with a national interest waiver unless there's like a priority date issue that you are concerned with. Either way, it'd be great to hear back from you. And we'll send you a text with the video we made for you and also links to payment information. Thank you very much. Hmm. Hmm. OK. So it looks like it's the end of this one because I lost ChatGP before.",,,,,

This is attorney Sherrod Seward, this time doing some work with the tech dev agency on behalf of the law firm that I work with on a consulting basis. And what we're trying to do is create a custom GPT on OpenAI's platform to help us kind of manage hot leads and get information quickly from all the leads that go into the firm. So I'm gonna go ahead and get started. I'm gonna do that by taking... They work great with spreadsheets. So I'm going to download the spreadsheet. Download our intake report. So next, I'm going to go to OpenAI and ask them to analyze both of these docs. Uh-oh. OK, now we got both of them. So they're both in here. Please analyze these documents and give feedback on how easy it is to accurately pull information from these So as it's doing that, I'm going to start looking like this. V custom GPT. Well. Challenges after standardization. That will. The following with the report. So I'm actually going to like. Like this. Create another one just because like this next part that I'm going to prompt is very important, so I just want to get some input on that. but I don't want to do it here, so I'm going to upload these again. Let's say in a form of question. I wanted to make the best reporting results in terms of asking a system GPT to pull out hot leads with certain descriptions and for those leads to include name, phone number, invoice link, etc. based on visa type, industry, What would be all of questions I would ask in prompt? I'm basically asking what questions should I ask myself? but here are some entries that might be asked and I would like the best questions to insert in the custom GPT configuration results are if there's outstanding invoices. Two, can you send me all of the tennis leads? Three, what are leads that appear to be from other than individual athletes? Four, It's are likely good, but do not. No. On Internet you see. is most viable six would like to know from the leads ones are most famous now please give us information we can use in the configuration that would pull great results from questions such as these. Now write this in the form of a part of the prompt, the actual configuration of this custom GPT. So now it should give me part of the custom configuration. Okay, so redo this so questions were just examples to be able to do more flexible results from inquiries like these. They may be different. Redo the configuration. So basically what I'm saying is those were just examples, but we need it to be bigger so it can encompass stuff like that. So once done, I'm going to copy and go back into here. Oops. our desired results. Alright, so it should be done and copy the source code. Let's see what we get. This is a quick one. It's not something I'm looking to spend a lot of time on. So we're just going to get it as far as we can. So let's go explore more. Create. call this one ILL, oh, I think I'm encapsulating, ILL sales document. Cypher. OK. Copy the code. No, no, no. This one is actually. So basically saying we're not going to take it outside of chat GPT for this one. It's just going to be in GPT. Right, so. All right, so let's redo it a little bit. And that's where we'll put the code. Oh, I did it too soon. Should have waited for it to finish. No problem. All right. Now we're going to also upload our files. Okay. Make instructions that tell build or nation names. Well, on the Internet to be considered. The documents are attached as a reminder. Alright, so I'm telling it again to look at these two documents to make sure they get referenced. In the GPT I notice this. Oh wait, I was wrong. I have to say thoroughly. Well, it's redoing the whole thing, but. If that's the case, then we can just get rid of that. We don't need that header. We do need a model description. We're going to wait for it to finish. Copy the code. And then we'll just roll with this. so that we have the best conversation starters. I'll start writing. No, no, no, no, no. Give me conversation starters for the GPT as good examples. Yeah. Just letting you know what type of questions we might be asking. Oh, this is great. Let's get to do anybody with Link. Save it. For this purpose, I don't know if I'd be testing it out, but I just want to see how quickly I can get this done. Honestly, it went longer than I thought. OK. Please give me the high potential leads from the last sixty days. Prioritize persons with high achievement profiles. Perfect. Wait until you see that part. So it looks like it works. Probably had that part blocked out. So let's stop sharing. And that's how we did this. I'm cold.",,,,,

I'm about to show you how to use StreamYard to set up broadcasts that are shown as live, even though they're scheduled ahead of time. And so we'll just kind of start from scratch. So what I'm looking in here is finding good videos that make sense to be shared across the web. And this time I'm not going to use Android. So I'm going to go schedule a live stream. and I'm going to pick the outlets that I wanna use. I'm trying to get away from doing my own page. I mean my own, so I'm gonna use the Innovative Global Holdings page to do that. Global Holdings, let me use this one. These I'm not gonna do because you have to be actually online to use These ones. So you can't use Instagram unless you're physically on it right now. So I'm just going to use these three. It's ten o'clock right now. So I can't use those. So let's put it on for ten fifteen. All right. Now I'm going to go to chat GPT. And I'm in the one that's I've already been talking about this stuff. We hide this. All right. So I'll put this here. I skipped the other part because it just wasn't applicable. And customize each destination. All right, so we've created one live stream. That's going to happen today. So now I'm going to go to pass. I'll go to the next one. Go to schedule live recording. Put it here, there, there again. We'll do that for tomorrow or like Wednesday. Change the time, but industries that we specialize in. Right. So then we copy, put that in here. All right. So let's go to the next one. Go to pass. Remember? Go ahead and load more. Schedule live stream. Same thing. But not immigration law. Get them right there. Here's the chat. Get this description going. I'm just going to see how many I can get scheduled for about ten fifteen. So I got twelve minutes. So this one, the description was too long right there. So we should be fine to go. Let's keep it rolling. And we're only looking for ones that, like, so if they're training programs, we're not putting training programs in there, obviously. But these three, remember, then put this over here. Vary the time, put it at two p.m. Go over here. It's pretty good. Take this out. on GTA. Great. Now I'm going to switch and see if there's some like immigration related ones that we can put on here. I have to switch this out. So I'm going to open another StreamYard up. And I'll show you why. So I'm going to download the text. I'm going to use a different GPT for this one. Video to text. We're going to upload and add that to there. Use this to make description for a live stream on the topic used. All right. So you can put this one and put one for tomorrow. So some more. Using O and B to E to, oh, this is great for STEM companies. So let's download that as a tech script. Then on this one, let's get it put up. So got quite a few going. So this one, I'm going to share the live screen. That one would be me because I'm talking about immigration related stuff at the talent agency and go on both YouTubes and that one. So I'll put this at Friday, switch it up and put an afternoon. All right, let's go to this chat, GPT. Upload. Thank you. All right. So now let's see what else is next. Download this as text. Then go find it on here, set the alarm stream. So that's the reason I have to because while that's loading, you can always go and find this new one. Executive consultations. Download. I mean, schedule live stream. So I'm going to upload the text here. Thank you. So let's pick our destinations. Well, that's an immigration one. This is an immigration one. So remember, we're going to use this. So you unclick that. Click this one. That one's fine. We want to make sure the format looks good. Get rid of that. So I'm just sure this won't be able to make it for the sixteenth or so. Great live stream. Now let's see if we can get two more quick ones with Innovative Global Talent. What do we specialize in? No, we already did that one. Oops, that's the wrong button. I meant to put share. Oh, no, I meant to put to live stream. So this one would be Innovative Global Holdings. Innovative Global Holdings right here. I'll go to this GPT. Okay. All right, so let's copy it. And of course, it's never perfect. So here we go. Then we'll do one more. So pass and load a couple more. You know what, I'll do this, because I do like this one. Download text version. Let's go ahead and schedule a live stream. This is the last one. Immigration, both of these, Twitter. So I make one of this. Let's get this formatting right. I'm going to use www.sharedsports.com. All right. And that will conclude what we're doing today for this one. I hope you see how we go ahead and schedule these lives and one of the big features that come with StreamYard. So for one, look at videos to make sure they're meant for the outside world as opposed to inside training for us. And if so, they can be used for the live stream and they can also be repurposed for Instagram Reels. Let me show you another one. So let's see. The other thing you can do is this. So if you enter the studio and you go edit and repurpose, you can use these to make shorts and reels for TikTok and stuff like that. So you're able to do that as well. So this is a good StreamYard training for you. Hope you find it useful.",,,,,

Appreciate you going through the training so far. Let's go to the next step. So one is we know how to look for bids that we like. We know how to log them onto the sheet. Now we know how to look for sources to address those bids. And the sources is where we'll get the items where we need to do our markups to then present the bidding process. So let's talk about how we contact the sources. I'm going to share my screen. This one. Okay, so let's go to our opportunity sheet. We're gonna look for one that is for sources sought. So I'm gonna go to this one. Let's see, surgical appliance manufacturing. What do they need? Bayer Healthcare Products. So let's go open the sources tab. Nope, it's not supposed to be there. So that's why we need to do it for, anybody can edit, otherwise you have to ask for the access, that's my fault. I didn't follow my own instructions. All right. Very healthcare. So we're going to look for somebody in procurement. US product communications. Sales and support. So we'll try doing the email first with the contacts that we have. So we'll take the emails right there. And really, these are communications. So it might not even be the right person, but maybe they can get us to the right person. We really want somebody like in procurement. And we should have already. have this here. All right. Now let's actually read it, make sure it makes sense before we send it. So there's two of them, so I'm just going to say hello. Taking some locations. So this might be too much information for them. Can we please get pricing information? So we can respond to this bid. All right. And be sure to CC Andre at Parsons Procurement. Okay, so when we send it, possible sources, it's going to say source communication. So then under source, oh, which one are we looking at? It was this one, right? So this actually should be, all these should actually be over here. And this should be the same email to them. Now let's see if we can call. So go back to the source. So that number didn't work. Let's just try calling their general number. 404. So I'll put it on speaker so we can see. Thank you for calling Bear Healthcare. This call is being recorded for quality assurance purposes. Thank you for calling Bear Corporation. If you know your party's name, you can dial it at any time. To spell your party's name, please press 1.

To become a vendor, please send an email to procurement-support-us at Bayer.com. Please press star to repeat this message. All right, so now we have the email that we can use. So we're going to go back to the sources side and say we called. All right, so now we're going to resend that email to that phone number. Copy Andre. You know what? Before I send that again, I'm going to change something real quick. I'll change. Manage. OK, so it says persons, OK. Which would change the name? Those persons. Sorry, I didn't see this in the training, but it was necessary. Okay. So let's resend. So we go to the sent one, and we will take this out. All right, and then we got that because we called them. Now, if they would have answered, we would just ask them for what was the right contact and what's their process like for becoming a vendor. And just sent the email from there. So that's all the calling part like really does. All right. Put vendor requests. Okay, send. And that is what you repeat for the fourth part, which is actually contacting the suppliers and getting a price. So what they responded back and you'd get the reprice and make sure that it lines up with the contract details, then you would put that pricing information right here okay so you make another document and then put what their price would be right there and that would be the training for module four uh so keep doing that part let's see where we can get some prices on these uh equipment I know that uh you can do it but that's what I the goal I want for the next couple of days I want to see the sources here I want to see the contracts up and I want to get some pricing going okay thank you very much",,,,,

And if you are watching this video, that means congratulations. And we're very happy that you're participating in our recruitment process. The recruitment process is very important, and we rely heavily on you to find and educate the talent out there of the tremendous opportunity we have at Innovative Global Talent Agency. The thing that makes us different is that we're founded by me, which is one of the premier 01 visa attorneys in the nation. And the 01 visa is very flexible and allows us to get people work authorization before they have a job offer. And the way we do that is by making sure we go after qualified candidates that are sure to get the 01, then also having an itinerary with us as a talent agency to help them fulfill their itinerary. So even if you do not have a job with the employer yet, you still have to have activities to do in the United States. So that's why we have our talent work on projects with us, whether it be developing software products, writing blogs or other things, maybe even doing their own projects so that we can show USCIS, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, that this individual does have activities in the United States, regardless if they're currently on a project with one of our employers or not. And so once they're in the portal, We will start their immigration process, and depending on the strength of their profile, we might have to continually give them more projects or ask for more information to get them through. And while they're waiting and doing these projects, we'll make a profile for them that the employers can look at to start the recruitment process. Typically, the employers themselves will reach out to do interviews with potential candidates, and that's how the process goes. So I'm going to share my screen to go over some of the key points that are here. So one is the first step to go is bring people to the website and we're gonna show them opportunities for candidates. Once they do this, they'll see this, make sure they fill this out because this is what helps our decision making team determine who we're going to work with. Once we decide that somebody is good to work with, that's when our recruiters earn their fee for placement. So whenever you're reaching out to contacts, you're going to be trying to educate them to fill out this candidate sheet. And once we decide that they are somebody we want to work with, that's when a fee is earned for that particular project or person. Now, if we're getting started, I did send over this information that says kind of the candidates that we're looking at. We're looking at these countries as key countries that we like. We like people that are PhD graduates in IT, tech, AI universities. We like social media influencers, people that have a lot of followers and a lot of good information on computer science, tech, and stuff of that nature. And even if they have their own agency, that's very great too. We like the, okay, there's the owners. We also have this LeetCode list. I'm going to open this up. Well, it's already open. And I'm going to share three sheets to get started with. So this is the LeetCode contact. LeetCode is a competition for computer software developers. that they compete in different type of competitions to get world rankings. What we're looking to do is get the highest ranking of these persons in our program. So kind of start with people like this one shouldn't be here because they're in the United States. Right. So this is one of the lists that we want to go through. The people that have the lower rankings are some ones that were definitely more looking forward to working with and somebody that might have like, uh, who's a really high one, like 8,000, we're probably not looking to work with them. Um, but definitely these people like right here, well, there shouldn't be people in the United States. We don't want anybody in the United States. So don't even reach out to them. I'm going to delete these rows. Yeah. People in the United States shouldn't be here. So that's a good point. We're only looking for people outside of the United States. Cause if they're in the United States that don't know visas. So the candidates to have the lowest ranking or the highest value to us. Um, but we'll take a look at anybody on this list. All right. The next one we have here are award-winning STEM and AI persons. These are people that have won awards in AI and data science that would make great candidates for 01 and people we definitely want in our program. You want to make sure that they're not in the United States as well. And then here is a very good list for us that's AI influencers. These are people that we know have a lot of followers and influence on the internet and would make a great candidate for us to partner with to get the O1B visa, which we like a lot. So what the job is, is just reach out to the people on these lists and then people that fit the profile of what we've been asking for. get them to fill out this intake sheet. I'm going to share a video that you can use from me when you're doing it, which is right here. And it kind of talks about this as a tool that you can use to help explain how this works. And what I also encourage you to do is just go and click through the website, especially this, these right here, and just get familiar with how our services work. OK. So this is the first training. Please look at this in detail. I'll have some information, including access to the sheets here. And we look forward to getting started. You can get started right away. And your job is just to fill out this and get them to fill out this. Once we decide that they're good to go, that's when your fees are earned.

"July.08,2024",Training for IGTA Recruiting,Training Video,Training for IGTA Recruiting,Training for IGTA Recruiting.mp4,Training for IGTA Recruiting.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward and I'm a partner at Innovative Global Talent Agency. And previous to that, I was an immigration attorney that specialized in O1P1 EB1A visas in the United States. And I'm very excited that you're seeing this video because it means that you are a candidate that we think is very, very special and integral to our talent agency. What we do is we work with the best minds in the world in specific fields that we know have a great need in the United States. Typically, the employers in the United States use the H-1B visa program to satisfy their job needs with foreign talent. There's a lot of issues and limitations with those visas that we solve by using the 01 category that we know so well. So the way the program works is we work with foreign nationals to obtain 01 visas and then make those profiles of those persons available to our employer customers for full-time employment and contract opportunities. In the meantime, one of the things that it takes to get an 01 visa is to have a very strong resume and background. And also you'll need an itinerary of things to do. To satisfy both of those, while we have people in the tech part space of our program, we have them work on certain projects to bolster their profile that we can present to USCIS, but also to satisfy the itinerary requirement so that USCIS knows that they have something that they're working on, even if they're not currently placed with one of our employment partners. So that's why you will have somebody come and contact you about working on different projects while you're working on your visa so that we can show USCIS that you have an active itinerary while you're not placed with one of our employer partners and to make sure that your profile for the visa is good because the O-1 is the highest level of non-immigrant visa that you can get in the United States. So the way the program works is the homepage is built to attract employers. and soon there'll be a special page they can go to to see profiles. If you are a candidate looking to work with us, what you would do is go to opportunities for AI candidates, if you have not already, and fill out the get started with us tab. This series of questions, please be sure to answer them thoroughly because this is where our recruitment decision makers decide who's a good candidate for us to work with and not. if they haven't just already selected you to do that. So please do this. Then the team will make a determination if you are good for our program. And from there, you'll get another intake sheet that will be used to actually start making your visa profile. So I'm glad that you're excited about working with us, and we're excited about working with you. Together, we're going to disrupt the way that we bring foreign talent to the United States and make a lot of lives much better. So again, I'm Sherrod Seward, managing member here at Innovative Global Talent Agency, and we are looking forward to working with you.",,,,,

This is Jared. Appreciate your work so far. I just made it. I'll put it like this. I know that you're using GPT to make your comments, which I don't have a problem with. The thing is, I don't want AI generated comments put out for me. So what I've done is I've made a custom bot on chat GPT that I want you to use, but you can only use it for when you're making comments from me. All right. So I don't want to see this used for any of your other clients. I'm gonna show you how it works. All right. So I know that you have an account. I'm going to make it so that you can use this with the link. Where the hell is it? Maybe it's over here. LinkedIn post creative sort of saw it. I don't see the damn thing. LinkedIn post creator. Is this it? Oh goodness. All right, so I gotta remake it. No problem. I'll show you how to make it then since you're here. How to press create. No worries. Enhance comments. LinkedIn. All right. This is good. So conversation starters. First, you want to say, what is the post we are commenting to? So that we put in the post. The second one is, are there any existing comments we like? Sorry, when it is there any links, thoughts, or goals that we want comments to have. All right, so let's create it. Anyone with link. That's what I didn't do. So I'm going to shoot you this link. Changes can be published because it violates. Your GP can't be shared publicly because of the lights are useless policies for this issue. Can't share this publicly. I'm not going to mess with that. All right. So you're going to have to log into my account. That's another reason why I can only use it for me. Understood. Understood. So only me. I will provide you the login to that. All right, let's run it. All right, so we're going to do one with this. Let's find somebody else. All right. So she's in Kazakhstan doing something, I don't know. So here is the post. No matter what it says, we want to say, well done and, They were a comments. Now look. We don't know that she organizes event. So I don't want to have comments that assume too much. Now this one assumes that I was there. So this one, you see, it doesn't assume that I've been there, and it just said, hey, good job. So we'll copy this and make sure that there's no comments in there. Write the quotations. Paste. And you can add them, probably. Bam. Oops. That is not the right person. All right. So we added her. Bam. That's how it works. So we're going to do one more. But obviously, I want this on the type of people that we're targeting, not just anybody. CEO of. This is a good one. See if BAL is the second biggest immigration law firm in the world. Let's have a go. Here's the post. So give us five. We want the one that sounds the less corny. So this one says, fantastic job on proposing that he didn't propose it. Bravo to the mayors for the forward thinking. Yes, we like this. But the main thing we don't want to do is give an action that they didn't say for sure was in there. All right, so we'll just use this one. Go ahead and comment. All right, I got to go. That's how that works. Let me know if you have any questions.",,,,,

This is me doing the training three. We're going to look at looking at the contracts and getting sources from them using a custom GPT I made on OpenAI. So of course, the first thing is actually getting into our OpenAI account. So you go to chat. I think we did update this. OK. Let's go to chat at openai.com. You'll have the login to get to this. Then you go to the GPTs and you'll look for sources sought bid. All right, then you'll have the contract opportunity up here. So I'm going to kind of start here. I actually kind of already did this one. So I'm just going to put that here. Where's that? And make sure that it's share to anyone with link and edit anyone with link and edit. All right. So that one's there. I'm going to start from scratch of what we're doing versus we need to link to the opportunities in all of these. And some of those, like we didn't have that so we can quickly find it. So I'm gonna start with this one that's due July 5th. which is today. So maybe you could even go and just ask them for the bid. Well, that'd be nice, but this is what we do. You get the notice ID, ransam.gov, because we need to put the link in. So we're going to go to search, contract opportunities, then just put the notice ID in here. I don't know why that happened. Okay, there we go. Sometimes you just got to put it twice. Why are there two of them? Original pre-solicitation, original solicitation. All right. So kind of read through it. Docs. So you can download. Download the docs. And then ASF. Now copy all this. All right. So now we're in the thing. You're going to upload the document. You want to paste this. sources for this bid. All right, so it's doing the staying place of performance. And you'll be like, hey, find me other sources that may sell this product to speak with. Meanwhile, I was doing this. We're going to go create a Google Doc. And you'll create this one and say, sources forbid. Put the contract number or the notice ID. So just copy and paste it there. Okay. Now please make a list of all of these contacts and then make a script to send to them from Parsons and procurement. Oh, not just Parsons procurement. Or email and call. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. So you see how it's getting some contacts to start with. So you can copy this down. Now we've got an email to send. Copy that. You want to get this right. And you make this. Separate this out. So for full bit details, you just Give them the link. To the portal. Alright. Let's go back and get the. I don't do that. The call. I don't want the text. So if you don't want like the get in the code thing, you just say like this. All right. All right. So then you will take this and put it in the sources part of it. Tab to make it go like that. Right. So let's, let's do another one. And you only do this for ones that are about for, um, widgets and not for, uh, sources that, um, services, like if they're building a roof and all that, then we don't do that for that. We only do it for stuff like this, where it's like, we're looking to buy something tangible, clothing, a microscope, something like that. Okay. So let's do this exercise again. Search. Go to all domains, put contract opportunities. What you got to do is put the notice ID. It might give an error the first time. It didn't this time. Boom. Open it up. Download all these. Right? Then copy this. Go to the custom GPT. Actually, open a new one. Attach all the documents. So I'm going to say, like, OK. Please, okay, please find me the best sources for this contract. All right. So now it's looking. There's the details. Most price acceptable. So they didn't actually give us a list. Please find suppliers. Okay. No. So here they're giving us service disabled owned business. So like, no, R-A-V-S. All right. Let's hear some sources. All right. So remember, we're going to create a new document, docs. New one. Sources. Sources forbid. Later, we're going to input that. I'll tell them to make a script. for email and for a call. So I need to get a contract ID for the name of this, right? And now it's generating the script. All right. Did I put that in the right place? I don't think I did. That's supposed to be right here. All right. So then we copy it. Put it here. All right. And that's that training for today. So I'm going to stop the video and just get to work on doing that as the next phase of your training. Thank you very much.",,,,,
"July.05,2024",Parsons Procurement Training 3 seeking sources,Training Video,Parsons Procurement Training 3 seeking sources,Parsons Procurement Training 3 seeking sources.mp4,Parsons Procurement Training 3 seeking sources.mp3,"All right, I'm going to start the second of the third part of the training, which is sort of looking for sources where we can obtain items for like the contracts. So let me go ahead and share my screen. Just going to share the entire window. All right, so let's get into it. So these ones, we're going to be looking for the contracts That are for. Non services. But right. The one thing was you need to link to these. Alright, so one thing is go back and put the link to the opportunity. Like I showed you. I think it might be a fast way for me to find it. Let me see. All right. Veteran source company. Brand name only. So we do is we'll put that here and we'll put it for, um, for this wholesale. Stay wide out of shot low meters for sale. So this is like, we're not looking for contractor opportunities. We're looking for the Palm one. We don't want sponsored platinum elite. So in this one, you know, it has to come from Platinum Elite. So we probably need to find, there we go, them. So that's my graph, Platinum Elite. This is the one that we need. So what you would do is take this link. This is called possible sources. You put it there. And if you see other ones, like other sources, you can just click those links there too. Medical Expo. But you know it's by MGC Diagnostics. So since we already got it, that's there. Now the other thing we could look for is see if we can see pricing. Oh, we'd have to go away. Let me close it there. How do you apply that? So if we could find a price of it, that would be great. What's next support contact us, but maybe like putting the contact info to source. So source contacts and over here, you would, you know, if they have a phone number. You just put that there. Right. Source price. So if they had pricing there, or after you find out what the price, you can put that there as well. But let's see. Are we up and moving yet? I know we're having problems with this. All right, looks like we're back. So what we could do. So let's see, we'll just have somebody call and ask for the price. And I can send them the bid. So that's how that works. Now let's go do another one. But notice, we're not doing this because it's relocation. Structural aircraft panel, right? So let's go Google this one. Go try it. Oh, wow. Data Pursuit. I'm going to have to look into this. So the competitive service is stable, set aside, all of that. First article testing required with delivery of first article, twenty days off the order. Panel structure aircraft. So look, you go over here. You can just put that in a Google thing. Huge GSE. So you're not really seeing anything. aircraft parts. Now, one thing to know is, like, so I'm looking at this. There they come, National Astro and others. Oh. Oh, so the pre-solicitation sees suppliers. So set aside. Contract awards, opportunity slack, contract vehicles. So in this one, when you see the solicitation sources, we could just go to them and call some. So you can go to Helicom international, right? Go and find them. But that's basically what you do. Like you'd go. It would be better, though, is if we can actually see the contract. So that's why we need the contract. Let's see if we can find it. Might be in here. Oh, not that. Search by the solicitation number. Yeah, I set up. So that's one thing why we need the link to the actual opportunity put in here. So put the actual link to the opportunity. What I mean by that is Contract opportunities. Right? So we go in here. Now, this is what I want. You click that link. And I want that here. So kind of like do that for all of those. So in general, what I want for these is like for the ones that have passed, we could really clean these out. As long as you already sent the messages to the contract officers. So if the data is already passed on these, you can go ahead and take it off. As long as you know that the contract officers are still in the purview. So it's like, let's see if we went to Craig. Do we ever send him a message? Well, it doesn't look like it. But make sure he hasn't been already sent a message and then kind of follow up with him. But then you could take that off because that time has already passed. So that has already passed. We could just really delete row. Delete row. June's first has already passed. Delete row. Then July first has passed as well. Okay. So we're in this contract for this structural panel. Parts shall be manufactured by the following sources. And they list these sources. So what we need to do is go to these sources, call them, and get the pricing of the items. And that's the guy that needs these pre-solicitation. So we need to get pricings from these procurement persons. And then that would get us the company that we need. That's one project there is call. So watch this. So I'm going to list these. These are the sources. Now let's get the actual description. Panel aircraft, so this is the item needed. Now what I want to do is make. Maybe it's on, so I'll get the best pricing for. Make instructions on the call to companies can get best pricing for this part for the duration of the contract. Explain that we are a. Set aside for a government bid. Uhm? Look. Potential sources. Alright, so let's see. So basically I'm asking it. To get this part. No, I want you to do. I want them to do the research for all those companies. So what I do is be like sources, forbid, and put that up there. Make this share, so anybody with LinkedIn view. Right. And then I would go here. Then instead of putting like the possible sources site or what's this? Let's go all the way down for these playing parts. I put this link. You can replace it with that. Because this one's going to have a lot of sources. All right, so that's gathering that. Let's see, at least got the instruction part. Here's the objective. We want to see how much they're going to give for a price for that. All right. OK. Don't know the training. What else do they have? Prepare a script for communication. All right, so here's one. Dallas, Texas. You don't necessarily have to do it for like all of them. All right. So we'll just try them for this exercise. All right, so we have all these, right? Now we're going to take these instructions to get a script. Right, so. I'm going to make the script for call and text. All right. Script. Email. All script. All right. So that's how we're going to do that one. Now, the next thing, so we're going to end that. Well, let's do one more. Let's do one more. All right, so what's this? Phoenix Surgical Instruments. So let's go here. Let's go back. Let me just click search. Put a contract opportunities. Put a contract in. Oh. All right, so here's a bid. Surgical. You know what we can do? Oh. Put a... Bye. So I'm having it make a custom GPT. Please be right. I'm still copying code. Let's go to chat. Explore GPTs, that's a great one. I'm not sure this is going to work. Let's copy the code. All right, so let's see if it works. So what we're going to do is go here. Please find sources. Is there anyone else to look for? So what would you want you to do now is just run it through the chat GPT and work it. Yeah, so this makes it even easier. So then what we do is open a new document. You go to sources for bid. Then you put the contract number. Where am I at? Right here. Put the contract number. Let's see what JetCPT sent out. I know what I need to augment this. Now. So let's copy the code once it's done. And then put that into the custom GPT. So done. I'm going to write email script, generate call script. Let's just put it in there. Explore my GPTs. They will load up in a second. Where are my GPTs? Let's edit. So it takes time, but it's worth it. I'm going to redo this video. I'm going to redo this video. Oh, actually, let me use the word to do it. Instructions for custom URL. Maybe because this is a Squarespace, I can do it. Let's see. so far so good we should try it out first is fine I forgot to get this information. So we need a government contracts portal. All right. So that works. One thing we need to do is create a custom GPT, I mean a custom link. Now to... Don't be on the website. What's up, John? I tried. All right.",,,,,

So how does the subscription model work? Well, it's charged on a monthly basis. And again, this allows us to set up the employer, uh, us agent for multiple employers, uh, structure for visa, which gets the, um, us stability to file for these old one visas and supply them to our clientele without them having to participate in the process. Our pricing is based on size of organization. For startups, we have a certain price. And then for our investor clients and larger enterprise clients, we have another price that is pretty fixed for now, especially as we're growing. As we get more clients and need to be more selective, Priority will go to keeping pricing the same for our first clients that come in the door. And then we'll start getting more selective because for us it's about relationships and people that believe in the process that we're doing because it's so unorthodox, but it's going to be very effective. And we're definitely going to be sure to reward people that recognize that and champion us to do our thing early in the game. But that's how the subscription service works. is you have a monthly subscription. And then from there, when you actually do place clientele candidates with the clientele, that's when there'll be placement fees, which are typical in the industry of talent and recruitment.",,,,,

But we are open to other industries that are undeserved and we can kind of work backwards from the accolades we need to prove O-1 visas. That's where a lot of times we might not get into an industry is because we know we will not be uh a highly successful in obtaining o1 visas just because that particular industry might not support the topic the type of documentation you would need to help prove that someone is the best in that particular industry but um we are flexible and we are um pretty innovative exactly when it comes to how to approach solving problems using O-1 visas.

They are oftentimes not successful. And there's just a lot of questions that come from the talent about the immigration process rather than actually working on those projects, including when it comes to permanent residence. So we made it so that no, the employer does not have to serve as petitioner and they do not have to serve as sponsor. Innovative Global Talent Agency will serve as the petitioner sponsor of the visa under the structure of US agent for multiple employers to our subscribed clientele. In addition, from doing these visas under the O1 category, persons that are approved are automatically great candidates for EB1A self-sponsored visas. And also we do industries where it's highly likely they can do EB2 national interest waiver. And the both, the great thing about that is the employer would not have to participate in any of those, either one of those permanent residence structures. Furthermore, as a talent being associated with us, we have our own legal counsel that we offer the candidates very, very low reduced fee consultations. So instead of asking the employer all the time about immigration options, they can just return to us to which we put them in contact with our immigration counsel. that will offer them great advice at a very, very low price to them, if any at all, because we do a lot of training internally, but we do have retained attorneys to do consultations at a very de minimis rate.",,,,,

We go all across the world to find the absolute best minds in the fields that our clients are passionate about and underserved. Now, the technical side of how we find them is a lot of times we are looking around the world for competitions and publications that highlight the best minds. We are looking at the best universities at their PhD level programming and at their innovation centers to contact their professors and deans to get the best minds we are looking on social media to see who's influencers out there who's talking a lot about these industries that could bring a lot of attention and maybe even whole teams uh to the things so we have about four to five uh different type of campaign types that we get on top of looking at H-1B casualties or maybe even talent that a recruiter or an employer might want, but they just don't participate in the visa process.

The one thing is we're disrupting because we're not making candidates applicable to job postings, whether we're finding organizationally challenging and game changing talents, regardless of job description. and ones that would be available for any type of role in that distinct area of expertise as opposed to a general job description. So we're not offering talents in response to job descriptions. What we're doing is we're offering world-class talent that you can apply wherever the employer needs them to. The second part is, is we are structuring our business to completely keep the client, the employers out of the visa process, whether it comes for both the green card and for their work authorization. So we're not saying, hey, we have a job applicant for you, here's the visa. We're saying this job applicant, well, this candidate already has a visa and is able to work for you tomorrow without you having to lift a finger on the compliance side for the immigration purposes. They'll have the work authorization ready to go due to the subscription.

There's really two reasons. One is industry standard and two is the structural way that we make the visa process smooth. So for industry standard, It's typical recruiting agencies will charge upwards of $10,000 per job posting to go out and start their mechanism for finding candidates. So instead of asking for this per job description, what we do is do the subscription service, which helps us basically run our operations and do legal things that we need to do at costs. The other part is structurally. There's a big structural reason and probably the most important reason we do this. is because this allows us to do the US agent for multiple employers structure of doing O1 visa petitions. So if we have contracts with our clients that say that they are expecting to receive candidates for us and paying a premium for that to happen, then we can successfully articulate to USCIS very consistently that we are using the US agent for multiple employers structure. what gets the visas done without having to involve the employers in the process.",,,,,

So here, grab our invoice for, invoice, legal fees. So we'll send that to her. Here. Grab that and send it in an email. Sharon and leads. Then also send that in a text to her. I said she's going to get phone calls. I might be able to get a text to her. Get her called out. I like if we could just send her a message. All right. It's kind of nervous a little bit. Copy that. And we'll pass it to her number. Put that right there. Let me see what she wants. All right, let's see. Can a great Toronto player, USL champions? Okay. They want to be an EB-A. Call the king. So let's put him in here. Give him a call. Hello, this is Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visas. We got your inquiry that you're interested in the EB-A. I looked at your resume, especially that with the coaching and your athletic skills set that you have with your background USL. I do confirm that you're a great candidate for the EB-A and we'd be very comfortable doing those arguments for you. So what I'll do is I'll have the team shoot you an email confirming everything, and then we'll also shoot you a text just in case you missed the email. But either way, thanks for hitting us up. We're glad you contacted us, and we're very confident in your case. Peace. So this one I'm actually going to send from sent from my personal account see if that gets uh something going and I'll send him a text message too I want to see if like these are still messing with the formatting. So you can't see this message I'm sending. Well, I can't see it. My inbox. Let's get the contact information again. This is Macaulay. So I'm sending an email from my account. And then we're also going to send them a voice message. I mean, not a voice message, but a text message. Grabbing that now. Alright, so let's keep going. Check more. Alright, so. What are you looking for? OK. Check more rebooting. So I'm looking them up now just to see what they have. Uh, did they fill out an intake sheet? Oh yeah. So we have their intake sheet. So let me go look. So play poker or working as a seller. Okay. Oh, yeah, for sure. He's great. Let's call Jack. So let's call Jack. Okay. Hello, this is Sherrod Seward with Sherrod Sports Visas. We got your inquiry for the poker-related visa. I've been looking up your profile. We definitely think that you're a great candidate for a P-I with your GPI ranking of No problem. But I do think that you are a great candidate for O-one. So you can have the work visa, too, just because you work with the company that did a lot of custom software. Software development is a huge in the United States right now, and they're looking for more O-one candidates under that. So what I'll say is we can definitely go for the O-one. And then for a chance, like if something happens, you don't get it. We would do the P-one visa just for filing fees. But I'm very confident that you'll get the O-one visa and there'll be no problem. All right. So if you have any problems, just give us a text and shoot us an email. We'll get you going. All right, so let's write them a message now. So I'm going to go take their information and create a message. All right, so I'm getting the message together for full links and everything. Follow up on visa assessment. So you're not going to be able to see this because I am sending it myself directly to them. my account but you know what I'll do I'll copy I'll start copying this yeah I'll copy you in it so you can see ExpressVisors.

How do they not have a phone number when they have a text message from here? So that's pretty, that's crazy. I didn't not have a phone number when I said we text from this number right here. That's crazy. Hello. Hello. This is shared sports visas. We've got an inquiry about a cricket athlete and we're just calling to follow up. Say it again. This is, yes, this is Sherrod sports visas.

Got you okay well we'll be here just text us when you're ready. Yes. What we do is if it was something we what usually happens if something is denied, which in your case is probably not likely just because we do a lot in cricket is you have like options for refiling at reduced fees. So we don't charge full fees for refiling. Yeah. RFEs are done on an hourly basis, which usually end up being under a thousand dollars. So they're usually around like six hundred or so. OK, no problem. Yep. So for them, we're just say we're going to check next week. Oh, man. okay all right so he's uh good he'll get to us next week see what's going on with trent found our office for a referral from a friend smith chad Let's see who he is. Verity at gmail.com.

That's not a good contact. I'm saying that because I don't think they have any money to pay. Here we have somebody with an intake sheet. Let's look at it. Oh, EV two. There's ones that we think are better for the EV two. So let me give them a call. This is a lot of numbers. I'm not sure if this is going to work. We'll try it. So I didn't pick up. So I'm just going to do an invoice link message and say we gave a call. Actual full links. So this one you'll be able to see doing confirmation. So I messed this up. Then what else do we have? So let's get their email address. Should be over here. Okay. Send it to them and do some BCCs. It's like we just had a new Wufoo come in. Let's see who that's from. Not sure. Greater freelancer. That's Shira Soko. So here's one that just came in. I don't have a lot of faith in this one. We'll see. All right, let's see if this is the same person. Date of birth, two thousand eight.

Say, see, are in the same field. So that's is um Or. or. or. And then you would see in a YPG cell machine that it looks like you have a visceral reaction, yet in this case, we can't even trust it. We're going to let you set this to something like that. We can't even control it. We're going to let you do it. only in america could you get away with wearing those clothes I know I wasn't one of the kids today because we're all supposed to walk around like that What's the point here? so you want future generations seeing get to the point of acceleration to see the second you know she you think that was generations to continue to push the more bold we just have to be like this and follow the black conservative space which which I'm going to I would like the description see what happened let's say you just say you recollection appreciation and gratitude for how all you come if you were not for the robert ely section Oh, . Thank you. Oh, did you, did you hear the pause so far? Oh, it was the first choice. But then she realized, and this was a black woman, she was like, oh, I can't tell you. I wouldn't say it in all circumstances. Oh, whatever her first choice was. She said, no, it's a city. It's a black small town. It's a city. It's a city. Also. Oh. so that's why um say Oh. Oh. It's. But all of a sudden, if I do whatever I want to do, let go. Let go. Let go. So. What you are simultaneously telling me is that you understand the pain and the pushback that grows with bringing up gym pros. The churches lay tiny emphases as they come out here to describe what you're telling me. It's not even just as easy or a place where they can get down to me or hit.

This is January 3rd, right before July 4th, and I'm getting ready to do my contract searching for my own internal team to show them what kind of opportunities we're looking for and how we find them. So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen and start from scratch on it. Like it's this one. All right, so let's get to it. see what we can find today. These are the contracts. Well, actually, these are the contracts we're going to use. These are the contracts we're going to use for it. Let's go into SAM.gov. By use for it, what I mean is that We already have those ones logged, so we're not going to log those ones. We're going to log against those to make sure that we get some new ones if they're out there. Got it. Let's start some searching. Contract opportunities. I feel like that was supposed to get someone. Do I need a user account? Get started searching. Follow contract opportunities. Must save searches. You can save searches? Oh, you should sign in so I could do that. That'd make it much easier. Yes, save the search. So, it's going to send you a one-time code. 24837. Okay. We started with your registry. Contract opportunities. Glossary. Oh man, what is this? Let's just go home. Federal service status. Federal users. Am I signed in or what? I can't tell. Let's go to search. And it's getting tricky on us. I want to sign in so that I can do a save search. So save a lot of time. So we're going to save that time today. All right, so we're in there. All domains, let's go by contract opportunities, filter by federal organizations. Let's go with, you know what, let's try it without, well, for the sake of searching, we're going to go to VA first. Department of Veteran Affairs. Okay. I'm just going to notice type. I'm going to do sources sought. I'm going to do pre-solicitation. And Solicitation set aside. Want to do. So source. OK, so let's see how we save this search. There's some actions. So let's call this. I do sole source and set aside which might be a sole source. So call this veteran sole source. Veterans sole source. So I want everybody to do that only. All right, then I'm going to change it a little bit. I'm going to take this away and say set aside. Veteran owned business set aside. Wait, which one do we do? Do the set-aside. This has a lot of results. These are April 4th response today. Awesome. I don't think this is going to be the next three months. That takes a lot of records away. OK, so we want to save this one as service set aside. I'm actually going to redo this one. We could redo the sole source. Undelete it. Veterans Affairs. Let's set up again, but we're going to put like next three months. Notice type. Sources sought. solicitation, solicitation set aside. This is, um, the sole source veterans, sole source service disabled, right? Well, that's, that's real good. We should . So I think we should get both of these. I'll copy this link address. I'll put this here. Which one is this? So software's purchased sole source. So basically what I'm saying there is there's only one place to get this software and they have to get it from a veteran disabled. So might as well just find out what the price is and mark it up. Okay. Instruct private and patient rooms. Probably not going to do that. Let's see what a medication hub is. Sources sought. Cabinets, lockers, and bins. Independent doctor securing narcotics. Yeah, this one looks pretty decent to go. Alright. So we like those that we save this search. Action save the search so this will be. Veterans so source only. Alright. So now we want to look at the plastics and ASICS code. So let's go to chat GPT, which I forgot. Let me go to log in. I'm doing this because I'd already looked at the NAICS goals for what we're looking for. Already above time I'm supposed to spend on this. That's cool. All right, so now we want to look at site preparation. All right, so now we're going to do like one that's for stuff we can do, a different type of search. So we're going to get rid of this. Next three months, we want that. We'll get rid of set aside. Place of performance, we'll look by states. We'll put North Carolina. Put Ohio. South Carolina. Georgia. Tennessee. Florida. We'll do this for the. naysayers codes for painting and demolition. So let's look at some more filters. OK, so we should be able to see. Oh, so we want place with product or service information. Okay, there we go. Okay. No matches for painting. If we put country, United States. This is nothing ever for painting. That's good to know. The other one we needed was site preparation contractors. So let's see if we have this. 103, new river replacement of The powder is piling clusters. I don't know what that is. Salisbury Brian project. So it looks like there's only one. So this one, we can just save as is called a demolition. Not set aside. I forgot how to spell this. I don't know how to spell it. Demolition. All right. All right, so the next one we need to look at is plastics. So we're going to get rid of this, rid of that. Say, can you So let's get some more. Let's load it up. These might want to look nationwide. So let's look at the. Nothing fan. There's on next year, so we're not getting anything. This one does not have to be country specific. Should we even do worldwide? Scrappy ear tags. This one's due in two days. OK, so at least we found one. Now let's go put in some more codes. OK. Let's just load it up. Let's see if it does this for me. There we go. Love it when they line it up like this. OK. Let's see if that works. Can't do it like that. So we'll do it like this. That one we already have. Lost it. Almost thought I lost my search. So this part's tedious, but it could be worse. Which one are we on? Losing track. One thing is that it doesn't seem like we're getting a lot of activity for these. That's fine. The ones that we do find, we will dominate. So we are doing the homework right now. Got three more to go with this, and then we'll move to the product service codes. I think it's our manufacturing. I'm not worried about that. I think we could still hook up with a supplier that could do this. Our other plastics. So wow, after that, we still only have two. All right. So let's go to these. Maybe we'll have luck. So I think what happens is they're going to. That's not what we want. Yeah. When it does update, it just does everything. So last time we did was 8110. So 8145. The back 4610. 4720. 5340. Oh, we're starting to get a little bit more. We have four results. I just forgot what I said. 8-0-3-0. Ceiling compounds. 8-3-0-5. Okay. So you can see we only got four results from this. For some reason, I thought we had five and then it took some more. Let's see, we've got scrappy ear tags. up or the solid made a male outpatient temperature sensitive. sensor sensitive coolers and gel packs. Cable guys. Let's see. Department of the Navy. material fabricating the various list of cable guides. Okay, so I'm going to save this search. Um, government wide plastics search. Okay. Now I'm going to reset, reset all of this and we're going to look by set aside for, uh, the vet service, veteran disabled. and also sole source. So there's 205, 2050 contracts. But we want to do notice type for sure to be sources sought, pre-solicitation, solicitation. We want the dates, offers due next year. So that should bring it down a lot. And then we can go through here real quick and just see what's. So we can go 100. Quick search. Upgrade isolation wars room. We don't know how to do repair service. Replace coil. We don't want to do that. Parasite for environment. Base operations, we don't do that. Surge protectors. So we can call these general opportunities. Good. So put there surge protectors. That's kind of broad. Transport utility carts. You can do that. That's a widget. Let me bring this over here. Identical microscope brand name or angle. So we need a microscope. I don't know what that sounds. There's a roof replacement. That's in Missouri National Park. So I said these are construction. Roof. So those are gonna go show to Brandon. Press for information. I want to do a request for information. Instruct something in Lebanon. I want to input something. Renovation. We don't do that. Instruct inpatient rooms. Housekeeping carts and trash cans. This is cool. So this one is arts and trash cans. Nothing's on fire. Let's get back to it. Pet mobile service. Now we're good. Here, relocation, go to release space, and Columbia. I can work on this with Jaleel. Send him. And I will put a note of this and submit to myself. Okay. Membership and sponsorship. What is that? Stair shares, powered evacuation stair shares. I don't know what a stair chair is. Is it due too soon? Anyway. Innovation public restroom. Can't tell what that is. Grounds maintenance. We don't want to do that. Install. We don't want to install anything. Construct an honor guard facility. Change that link. I don't know what that is. There's some janitor services in Oregon. That'd be hard for us to do right now. Final tour of this flooring. So put this as flooring. There's construction. Then I put one that said construction. Oh, there it is. Can't tell where it's at though. All right, let's continue what we're doing. Furniture, minor construction, staffing service, software maintenance, improving surgical access, campus perimeter barrier. Area MBA. Prepare aquatic center. Shire packet tables. It'll be like this. You're going way over. At least we're doing it correctly. So we don't want to do that. It's just testing stuff. That's too far in. Roof repair. August 6th. Let's see where it's at. Closes. Okay. So this is in... New York. So grab that as general. Put that under construction related. And put in Wolfing New York. OK. That is cold water, cold weather here. It's gonna be easy. Termite pest control. Urgency generator. Art governors for military generators. I think we already put that on there. I wanted to do a dryer replacement. New plumbing. This one might be easier. Bayer Healthcare, brand name only. Cool replacement. We don't want to do that. Innovation. I'll get that. I'm getting a little tired now, so. So remember, we're looking for widgets and stuff we can just sell to them. Pinsir, surgical instruments. We don't want stuff that we have to do stuff to after it's purchased. We just want to sell it and be done with it. We don't want to repair anything, unless it's like roofing, demolition, or painting. Chris Alvarez, My case where here's another roof repair one response to July 12 or bliss. Chris Alvarez, This is in New York. Chris Alvarez, So under this one. Chris Alvarez, we'll put on. Chris Alvarez, Construction related. Chris Alvarez, New York. 300 of these. That's the same thing. New storage facility. Interface cards. I don't know what a warehouse tug is. Court reporting. We don't want to do that. panel. Structural aircraft. B-52. This is pretty cool if we can get him a Boeing. Maybe... That's not Boeing, right? But you know what I mean. All right, water glass, construction, addition of mental health. I see ceiling lifts. And we already had the medication hubs on there. So it's like a brand-name-only item. We like that because there's not a lot of opportunities to get that wrong when you're sourcing it out. So you can really go to one source and that be it. Replace roofing. See what it says. Chicago. I think we already have this. All right. OK. So I think we're going to stop it there because somebody else can come in and do that part. But what I will do is save this search because we're just looking at source site. And like everyone, it's called a general set-aside search. So I'm going to save as a general set. All right. Then we'll save that. And that'll be the end of this searching training. Thank you.",,,,,

Since then, we've done a lot of problem solving and actual development of very useful tools that I think be helpful to not only immigration attorneys out there, but service providers in general. So I want to invite people to come and test out the tools that we have in production to give honest feedback and then see if some of these solutions could be useful for your business with some tweaking. With that said, thank you to Mary and thank you to Andres for having a lot of patience with me. And I know that we're going to continue making a lot of tools.

"July.02,2024",O-1A visas for coaches - using the accomplishments of pupils and students,Immigration Sports,O-1A visas for coaches - using the accomplishments of pupils and students,O-1A visas for coaches - using the accomplishments of pupils and students.mp4,O-1A visas for coaches - using the accomplishments of pupils and students.mp3,"Hello, my name is shared seward I'm the intake attorney here at shared sports visas innovative immigration law and right now I'm responding to a great inquiry from a tennis coach about the ability to get an oh one visa. So when we're talking about coaches, sometimes it can be challenging to get the O-1 visa because the coach is not the person themselves that's doing the accomplishments. Of course, a lot of times they're students and pupils that's doing that, which is not a problem, but it's just that we have to be careful about how we can and what's available to make those connections seamless. So not only do you have to show that your pupils did accomplish major activities, but you have to also show your contributions to it. The best way to do that is from a statement from the athlete themselves that attest that, yes, this coach had a significant contribution to my success. And the second way to do it is from independent third party verifications, whether it be from articles written about the situation that mentions both the athletes and the coach and the significance of the event. And then from there, you can also look at expert opinions that can kind of close the gap in the context of how the coach specific skills were able to help the individual. And the inquiry that we received, we saw that one of the pupils won a gold medal. That is tremendous, tremendous helpful evidence because there's something called the comparable evidence theory in 01, which specifically allows for individuals to claim that they should qualify for different eligibility criteria within 01 based on the activities of somebody they worked with. And there's a specific example that says a coach of a gold medalist is a great candidate for using the comparable evidence theory. So if you have an athlete that won a gold medal there, you can use the comparable evidence. You try to use it for single major award. A lot of times it doesn't work, but we can use that for memberships. We can use that for original contributions. We can use that, of course, for lesser awards and some of the other things that are out there. As far as like publications, publications about the student and the award, we could argue for that, too. But the thing is, we have to prove it. So if it's not something that's on the Internet readily available, where the athlete's mentioning the coach, then it's best to have a message from the athlete themselves or from people that are in the know that know them both or can ascertain to the relationship that was there of how the coach helped this person win a gold medal. And that goes for the other persons too, not necessarily the ones that won the gold medal, but any type of student that had great, great accomplishments that fit well within the O-1 theory. then the coach can also take advantage of those for the L1 visa. And in this particular case, we think this person is a great candidate based on how much they were able to help other tennis players reach the highest pinnacles of the world in sport. So we're glad to confirm this candidate and hopefully look forward to working with them. Thank you very much.",,,,,

And one of the typical ways that it is pitched to do this is through the EB-5 investment program to where you have to spend at least $800,000 and usually upward of 18, $1.8 million at the end of the day to get this visa. But there's a couple of drawbacks. One is there's a lot of people invested in getting these investments. And so they push it. And then they don't talk about how long it takes to get these EB-5 visas. And then there's not a lot of attorneys out there that understand how to use the O1 structure to get better and quicker results for entrepreneurs out there that want to be back and forth between the United States and eventually immigrate here. So that's what I'm going to talk about right now. I'm talking about the O1B. version of the 01A is great for business persons that also have a outward presence, like an influencer type presence. And the big difference is because when you have an 01B person in your organization, you have the ability to file for o2 visa applications for anybody that's associated with them and it's essential support staff role so a lot of times when we meet businesses they'll have multiple founders that will all want certain types of access to the united states if they were doing eb-5 investment visas they would each have to do that investment Right. So what we like to do when possible is we'll look at the background of each of the founders or maybe even executive that has a really extensive background that might be forward facing. For example, if they've done articles, if they've appeared on news features, if they have their own content like a podcast that they put forth. And then we'll evaluate each of those founders and executives to see who are the best or the single best candidate for the one beat. We'll file the O1B visa on their behalf and then for the other founders, unless they want one for themselves, we'll do essential support staff visas. And the thing about essential support staff is we can do multiple people on the same application. So for cost efficiency, and also flexibility, that is the best structure. The 01B visa a lot of times will cost around $10,000 on the legal fee side of things, while the 02 applications are usually between $4,000 to $6,000 each. Each comes with the ability to obtain O3 visas for family members, which means spouses and children under 21 can get these O3 visas that each all last three years. And they can use that to go to school. They can't use that for work authorization, but they could definitely use that to go to school. So that's what I think is the best avenue for this.",,,,,
"July.02,2024",O-1A versus P-3 for Muay Thai Athletes to train and do seminars in the US,Immigration Sports,O-1A versus P-3 for Muay Thai Athletes to train and do seminars in the US,O-1A versus P-3 for Muay Thai Athletes to train and do seminars in the US.mp4,O-1A versus P-3 for Muay Thai Athletes to train and do seminars in the US.mp3,"Hello, this is immigration attorney and talent manager Sherrod Seward responding to a great question about Muay Thai athletes and what category is best for them to come to the United States. Of course, it depends on why. In this particular case, we understand that the Muay Thai athletes are coming to coach and do seminars as opposed to just compete in competitions. For that reason, the P1 visa is out And we're now looking at the O-1 visa, which is for extraordinary ability for nationals. And we're looking at the P-3 visa, which is for cultural significance. And the question is, which one's the best? The best one to get is the O1 if they qualify. If they're high enough achievement that they've done great things that would put them in the top of their field when they were competing, or even as coaches now that when they're done competing and have continued to contribute to their sport, we would do the O1. The O1 gets three years. That's why it's really good. And it also has a great breadth of flexibility when it comes to work authorization. So you can do seminars. You can do coaching. You could even compete if you want to. There's a lot you can do with that. The thing with the O1 is just more expensive. To do an O1 application, you're usually looking around $10,000 in legal fees on top of the filing fees that are there for each athlete. Now, sometimes you can do an O1 visa for one of the athletes, and if they have rapport together, you can get the other athletes there as essential support staff. which are usually around 2,000 per individual. And you can put multiple individuals on a single essential support staff application. So if the best one of them gets an O-1, then the rest, if they try to train together or have some rapport together, you can put the rest of them on an O-2 visa application based on that O-1. And there would only be really two filing fees that you're doing, one for the O-1 and one for the O-2s. The second way to do it is say, for example, if there's a budget constraint or if there is no one of those athletes that have the background to get the O1 themselves, then of course you can look at the P3 in this circumstance. The P3 is appropriate when there is a cultural tie to that particular nation of the activity taking place. In this case, Muay Thai originates from Thailand, where they're from, and is the national sport of the country. Not only does it have the sport kind of acumen, but it's also very intrinsically bound into the fabric of how the spirit of the country works. People from all over the world come to Thailand to learn Muay Thai skills because that's where it was born and that's where the best training can happen. So definitely there is a pathway for the P3 to be used in this circumstance. Now we'll talk on the practical side of it. So the P3, unfortunately, is only available for a year at a time. And it still takes pretty significant documentation to do these visas. So even though the P3 is only good for a year, it really takes about the same amount of work as an O1 in many cases to get it through. For that case, there's a lot of time it prices out of what people are willing to pay on the legal fees for doing a P3. So what we do is sometimes at the talent agency, we'll take on a consulting role in bringing in athletes and helping them find opportunities. So if it was something where you're looking at the P3, it probably wouldn't be with the law firm. It would probably be something that would need to be sponsored on an individual basis. by the talent agency, which has its own fee, which is much less, and the talent agency would apply on its own for those particular visas. Now, the thing about the P3 is that you can apply for multiple persons on the same filing. So if you have individuals that have rapport with each other, they can be brought on a single P3 application for multiple beneficiaries, which further helps with the cost of doing this. um so that's best how to answer your question if there is one with the background and the resources are there uh the o1 is the longer option and the most robust if there is a budget concern and there's a background a concern where not any of the athletes would be um eligible for their own O-1 visa, then the P-3 on a consulting basis might be the most applicable option. So I hope this was helpful to everybody out there, and especially the person that asked this question. And we look forward to doing more Muay Thai.",,,,,

Normally, this is something that costs $400. But for people with the program, these follow up conversations are available for $35. Actually, it might be $25 to where you get a conversation with an attorney and also in a follow up email. So it kind of behooves you to have all your questions up front once you're in the process of doing that. Now, the way the drafting works is that once something is initiated, they will start getting a draft together and compiling evidence that they need to convince USCIS of extraordinary ability. Sometimes there's just not enough information there and they'll come back and request more information. Or it might be the case that the profile is not strong enough on its own and there's a need to wait for more robust things to come through. That's why we have a program to where there'll be building of programs while you're in the AI tech development program. So that way those projects can bolster your application.

And one, probably the one I'm most proud of is working with Tyson Fury, uh, because of who he is as a champion and as a person in life. Uh, Tyson Fury was the lineal champion because he beat the last person that was undisputed. And, um, he went through revenge in life where he almost lost his life a couple of times due to his lifestyle. After that, he came back, started from scratch, and won his way all the way up to being a world champion again. And I was able to do his O-1 visa work and have the opportunity to meet him. And it's just different when you see him walk in a room because he's almost like he's on borrowed time. He's a champion that's lost before, got up, and come back. And I was able to witness his last fight with Deontay Wilder where It was one of the best heavyweight fights of all time where both men were knocked onto canvas. And I think that experience that he had from losing in life and coming back also allowed him to do the same thing in the ring. And that's why for me, I always appreciate champions that are defeated before because these champions, can show you who they are as a person from the way they come back. Before a champion loses, he could be dominating everybody that comes in front of him, and we never get to learn how they react in adversity, which is, I think, one of the biggest factors of how life should be. It's all about how you respond to adversity, because it's going to be there no matter what. So Tyson Fury, that's my favorite client, and now you know why.",,,,,

Just kind of showing you some more updates and training on how to look for bids and what's out there. All right. So search editor. I got to kind of remember how to do this myself. Contract opportunities. Set aside, we definitely want veteran service disabled. We can look at sole source. All right. Then the notice type. Want solicitations. And we got pre-solicitation too. Let me get some ASICS code. Hmm. those associated with painting and demolition. So, all right. Contract, place of performance, more filters. product or service. I don't see the product or service. Oh, there we go. And then, uh, let's see what demolition is site preparation. All right. So we don't have any service disabled set asides. So source is like, if there's a set aside, so we do have some of these, where are they at? I wish they do July. Oh, so this one. It's in North Carolina here, Salisbury, yeah. Due July, the twenty-second. So let's go ahead and grab these contract opportunities. That one's in Texas. Open these tabs. All right, so then I'm going to take these and put these in an email. I'm going to use a different email address for it. All right. Where are the other ones at? So what I'll do is I'll make the screen easier for me to do this with. Just kind of split it. I didn't even have to log in to look at these contracts. I'll send this off to myself. OK, cool. So now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to look for a different type. So I'm going to get rid of these and look for sole source, construction urgent care, building addition. Place performance. State or territory. Let's do North Carolina. Let's do Georgia. Let's look at Ohio. So it looks like there's no sole source. There's got to be some sole source somewhere. So there's fifteen sole source part for governors, for military generators. Yeah, I think this sole source. These are the good things to bid on. Oops. Where did I find that? I'm about to redo it. So right now I'm going through and I'm looking for widgets. So like things that we can sell that are not service-based. I'm just going to grab these. This is for generator parts. We don't want to do innovations. Race removal in Houston. Boiler testing as there's waste. Fuel management. The only thing about fuel operations. single source for stress. So response date is June twenty fifth pre solicitation. So that's nothing roof repair. Well, you know, there's a rooster. Let's see where it's at. Original response date. Pre solicitation. Magnitude is between one and five million. Roof. So it's a different. Roof job in Denver and pre so. pre-solicitation. HVAC pay appeal, we don't want that. Services. A lease plan. An evaluation, that's something to do. Security monitoring, we don't want that. Construct private inpatient rooms. Instruct private instruction rooms. I don't think we know enough about that. So that's that nationwide for service disabled set aside. So now when we add, well, that was sole source. So now when we add a set aside, total small business set aside, we want veteran disabled. So let's see how many we have. We have like, six hundred results here. So here maybe we'll look at, we already looked at the NASES codes for painting. Let's see if there's any painting, just to make sure. I believe we did already look at painting. We didn't see anything. All right, so no painting jobs. Let's see what the product code. What is the product and service code for plastic? Shredders, nine, three, three, zero. We know plastics. Oops. Nothing for plastics. We do plastic sheeting. Offers do. Yeah. So this is a good one for us, plastic sheeting. B-S-O-B-D, set aside. So I'm just marking that. This one is sole source. B-S-O-D-B. Whatever it is. So source source means sole source means they can only get it from this business set aside means that it's set aside to see if they have, um, businesses available to do the type of work that are, that are in that. So that's pretty good. I wonder what type of place. So if we take this off, right. One of the type of plastic stuff there is anyway, elevator establishment seven. Roller smarty. Barber glass Bulldog statue. Portable toilets. This is open. open solicitation. Okay. So that means anybody can bid on it, but maybe it might be worth looking into. Tape. What type of tape are you talking about? Did I do that right? I think I did. Type of tape. Small business set aside. Okay. So let's actually open it up. Inspection level, seven days. Navy installation. It's a long document. All right, I don't know. But that's how I looked for today. Turn for Brandon. Alright, so now again I'm going to email this to myself. Okay, so that's what we have for this time. Did you go find the streamer? There we go. So I hope this training was good. We'll stop it there.",,,,,

Go ahead and hide this. Save. Then let's also get his topology. And one thing we like to see is rankings. So this must be the Russian rankings. So let's look up Grozin. So he's the third best in Russia. He is knocking people out. Let's get rid of all these ads. Let's see, he has regional rankings here. That's an international ranking right there. You know what I'm gonna also do? I'm gonna make a Google doc and start highlighting some of the information we find here. So I put ranking, topology. Right, so he has a lot of great fights. He just needs to get out of Russia. So we'll get all five pages of those. Now we're going to look for him in Fight Matrix. I'm going to put Fight Matrix. There he is. His current world ranking is one hundred and nineteen. So we're going to take this from one to six. Custom one to six. All this frozen. All right. The next thing you want to get is showing him amongst the other world ranked fighters. So he should be right there. So let's do one to five.

The reason is because I forgot to grab. Oh, it's over here. grab this information, because this can go into the petition. All right, so I put that there. Also put the URL here. Rankings. So then we had the MMA junkie. It was in this tab. Like Intermade Junkie because it's with USA Today. Sometimes you want to get the About Us. Right? So we got the About Us. Beautiful. Russian national fight. Let's see if we can find something about this. Well, let's look a bit more into this. This is not a great outlet. That's him losing a championship. So that's about Rosen in this. Yes, I hope that's out. Let's go to World Champion and see if anything comes up. All right, so let's look for his national team stuff. That's not really helpful. So I'm not finding a lot on this guy. I don't see grows anywhere in here. That's all we got. National team. All right. So that one we went and tried to do what we could.

If you don't know already, I focus on P1s, O1s, and EB1A visas for athletes, entertainers, and professionals from all around the world. Today, I'm doing a late night video in my UFC London t-shirt. This particular one was the Aspinall fight where he didn't win a championship yet, but he was well on his way. Kicked a lot of tail that night. But let's get into it. As student athletes in the United States are able to take advantage of name, image, and likeness opportunities, there is a great need for a lot of students that are currently still in school to switch over to P1 or O1 visas so that they can have the work authorization required to receive payment for their NIL activities in the United States. Now this creates a couple of issues, especially if you're a current student and need to make sure that you have status. So in this particular circumstance, we have an inquiry from a golfer who is a highly ranked amateur golfer around the world and has a great background and accomplishments in golfing through their NCAA career. And prior to that, they were a national team member at the youth level. They're looking to switch to a P1 visa so they can take advantage of some NIL opportunities they have coming into pipeline. The issue is they need to travel back to their home country for a couple of weeks and come back. And the question is, when should they file for their P1 visa? The answer is file for your P1 visa right away. And the reason that is, is because while it's pending, anything could happen, but you always want the opportunity for something to happen, whether it's approved or a request for evidence comes in, especially if you're going to file under regular processing, because it's just going to take time. The thing is, once the visa is filed, we can always change it from expecting to be consular process to be approved while the person's in the United States. So what we would do is file the application and let the person travel and go ahead and extend their f1 visa status so that way they have the option of either going to the interview for the p1 visa or to extend to f1 but they have a bona fide way to get back to united states if it's the case that the p1 visa is not approved by the time they need to come back they can use that f1 to come into the country and then when the p1 is approved we uh well when they get back to the country we're going to send a notification to uscis to let them know that their i-940 i-94 is updated and that they wanna adjust from that F-1 to the P-1. If the P-1 gets approved in time, and also there's enough time to consult process, we'll do the same thing to where, well, we'll do something different. We'll have them go to the embassy and get their passport stamped with the P-1 visa instead of the F-1. But probably in the circumstance that they're leaving in a few weeks and coming back a few weeks after that, the P1 visa will still be adjudicating on regular processing before they come back. So the most likely situation in this circumstance is that they'll extend the F1 visa, come back on that, and then the P1 visa will be approved sometime after that. And always remember that you have the opportunity of adding premium processing to any P1 or O1 visa application as long as it's still under processing to get those 15 business days response time. So I hope that athletes out there and their parents find this helpful to know the nuances between the consular processing portion of switching between F1, P1, and O1 visas. Thank you very much.",,,,,

This is attorney Sherrod Seward, known worldwide for my work in P-1, O-1, and EB-1A visas. Right now, we're just waiting for the Instagram. Got it going. So, let's get into it the USA select well, the select USA conference is put on every year by the Department of commerce and international trade. Uh, department to be specific, and it's usually put in the hotel near the national harbor in Maryland, very close to D. C. And it's a great venue, a great conference. And it's a space where a lot of the government entities that recruit businesses internationally to set up shop in their various jurisdictions, bring people from all over the world that are interested in setting up their businesses in the United States to see what type of opportunities are here, and also meet with service providers such as myself to see what options are available to them and what makes sense. My goal here is to really try to educate people on the advantages of using the O-1 visa as opposed to some of the other investment and business based visas that are out there. For example, most investors around the world are really heavily focused on the EB-5 investment visa, which is a very expensive endeavor and a long process. So if you're not familiar, the EB-5 investment visa involves minimum investment of $800,000, but usually will end up being around $2 million that the interested investor will end up spending. becomes the united states and it has a couple of drawbacks for one is how expensive it is second it's pretty invasive as far as having to show source of funds and then at the end of the day the visa process under ev5 is not going to be successful if you do not create 10 american jobs at the end of the day which is expensive on its own and can be very hard to do especially if you've never done business in the United States. For that reason, we try to educate the market to say that a lot of times a business person that can get an EB-5 is also eligible for an O-1 visa, which is based on their talent as opposed to their investment, which means that they do not have to show a minimum investment. They do not have to show a lot of time source of funds. And there's other advantages that come with it as well, including timing. Under premium processing, you can be in the country and under two months if you're outside the United States using the O-1. It's also a very good trans way to get an EB-1A visa, which is pretty much making the same arguments as the O-1, but it's on the immigrant green card track. So that's what we're doing here at the Select Conference. We're doing consultations on spot and meeting with a lot of great people from all over the world that can take advantage of the knowledge of using the O-1A visa instead of the EB-5 to do the O-1 to EB-1A Transition Permanent Residence United States based on talent with a lot of money in your pocket. And you can also get your support staff, family members here, children can go to the school. It's just a really great program that more people should know about. So if you're interested in it or even here at the SelectUSA conference, we're not hard to find. We're near the networking hall and just come say hello. Be good to meet you. Have a great day.

And what I'm doing today is talking a little bit about the drafting process, excuse me, even though that I'm in business development, just because I think it's important to set expectations and know what the reason of it is and why the process is like it is. All right. So the thing that we attorneys use support letters for is to provide context. And for the sake of process, we use these support letters to put certain buzzwords and structure to the arguments that we are making in the support letter, the petition letter that goes to USCIS. For that reason, like We are more focused on the arguments that we're trying to make, and we don't necessarily know every single detail that there may be about the individual. So that's why we did the process like this. We asked for the individual's name and then some profile information about them. And then we go look them up to see what type of arguments they can best support. And then we use the public information available to us to do the best we can to get the one, the arguments that we need in there, then to have places where we have information about the person as far as we know that are in there, too. Then we go and take that draft and send it to the client to go fix for any accuracy in the details, because the details are not necessarily what we're most concerned about. We're concerned about the structure of the argument, and we do not know these people enough to get every detail right. So that's why we send it to the client to go ahead and correct those i's dot the i's cross the t's get it signed and send it back to us but don't mess with the structure of the arguments just you know if there is a award that's said incorrectly just go address that if there is a detail about the description of the award go ahead and address that and send it back to us because a lot of times we just don't have that information available to us on public record and the person themselves just knows a little bit better about that and that's fine in a natural part of the process so if you notice uh you know, mistakes and details here or there about the support letter, just know that's normal because we're setting up arguments and try to support that structurally. But we do not have a lot of the details available to us to get everything just right. So that's why we send you a draft so that you can address it with crossing the T's, dotting the I's, and getting it back to us for ultimate execution. Thank you very much.",,,,,

Sometimes the results you want do not happen, and it's shocking. There's one thing that comes with the just disappointment for everybody when a visa is unfortunately denied, but there's also a certain amount of just real life factors to be considered when there is a visa that wasn't expected to have any issues, have some issues. The inquiry I'm discussing now is a situation where there was a 01 filed for a former World Championship boxer that wasn't active. And maybe it might be the case, we didn't know at the time, may never be active again. And there was an 02 essential support staff visa attached to that 01. And it was the case that the 02 visa holder was actually very, very important. maybe even more important to the employer than the O-1 principal visa holder themselves. So the thing that happens when a O-1 or a P-1 gets denied and there are essential support staff tied to it is going to be pretty quick that the USCIS is going to deny those other visas. Sometimes they do it so quick they don't even know what they're doing. I had one case where we had two petitions filed for the same P1. One was of a shorter value as far as timeline, and then we had another one that was for three years. So when the one that was shorter got denied, USCIS denied the essential support staff visas that came with it, even though there was one clearly pending that was longer. so we had to email them to show them how stupid they are you know it's what it is and they just went and reopened the case without us having to file any type of appeal or anything because they completely made a mistake in this circumstance um the denial was very very unexpected and so when the denial came for the essential support staff there was a pause Too long of a pause to determine from the employer side what's going to be next. Because when there's a denial, you get about 33 days to file an appeal and kind of keep the status going. Because when you are denied a visa and you don't have anything else there, you really have 30 days to figure something else out or leave the country. But there's some times, unfortunately, where that doesn't happen and the person stays in the country longer than what that grace period was. So what do you do? If you do not want to leave the country, which maybe you should, but you do want to stay, you never want to stay longer than 180 days because that's when you start triggering automatic bans if you get deported or if you try to constantly process it by going out of the country, coming back in. So the best thing to do is file another visa application immediately and then provide an explanation, which is called nunc pro tunc, where you basically show USCIS what was the reason or the delay in addressing the out of status time. And you make it a good argument. and you be nice about it. Because at the end of the day, it's at their discretion. They do not have to do it. So in this case, honey goes a lot more than hot sauce. So when you do your non-proton arguments, you're going to want to be transparent. You're going to want to show receipts, conversations. You're going to want to show whatever documents and timeline you can show to support what you're asserting of why the explanation is that you did not file a visa in time for you not to incur unlawful presence. In this case, there is a good argument and there's communications there to show there was confusion on whether to file another 01 02 combination for everybody ready to use another athlete or have the person file a direct 01 visa for themselves and we have the communications to show that that what was going on so what we'll do in this now proton is submit those screenshots to uscis being careful of course not to reveal anything that we do not want to know this that's none of their business but to let them know like hey there was a effort to work with our council work with just the powers that be in the world to figure out the best way forward and it's just something that didn't get done in the time that we wanted but it was addressed the other thing you want to show is a history of the beneficiary that's in question coming and leaving the country uh within the rules done it before in the past then it's likely that this was just a one-off and not an indictment on who they are as a non-immigrant uh visitor to the country and that's what you can do show prior history of complying with the rules and explain very well with documented receipts of why the rules were not followed in this one-off particular extraordinary reason So I hope that answered your question about what to do about unlawful presence. The answer is make it short and supply a non-potent argument with exhibits to prove what you're asserting. Thank you very much.",,,,,

This is Attorney Sherrod Seward, Specialist in P-101 and EB-1A visas. Today, we're talking to our STEM audience, science, tech, education, and math. Very important, especially nowadays where we have such a push towards data scientists, software developers, and of course, artificial intelligence professionals. In this case, we have someone that is very adamant about getting an EB1A, and we did a consultation for them, and we're going to share this video with them as well. That speaks to why, in their case, it may be more advantageous to go for the EB2 with a national interest waiver, an NIW. That's because it's a less, depending on your industry and the times and circumstances of what is filed the national interest waiver can have a much less burden bar to be eligible than the eb-1a there's no way of getting around on the eb-1a that you have to be one of the best in the world at your field and we have different ways of articulating that to our favor but it is always a hard hill to climb but we do it all the time the thing is sometimes you don't have to In the ideal world, we would file for both the EB-1A and the EB-2 national interest waiver if the client has the resources to do it. That's just because it gives you more chance to get a fair adjudication from the officers because you'll likely have two different officers because they're two different preference categories. Now, this particular person is a STEM and data computer tech, and they have good citations. They have contributions to projects that have significance. And the subject area of what they're doing, these activities are considered right now very important. To be specific, right now, the Biden administration has a huge push on keeping the best minds in STEM and artificial intelligence in the country. So while they are here in office, which is at least until January, it's a great time to take advantage of the NIW because you can put forth the administration's own words as powerful, persuasive arguments to why the national interest waiver applies. Now, what does the national interest waiver do? Well, to back up, if you're doing an EB-2 without one, you're going to need a job offer in order to pursue the EB-2 and probably get a labor certification. With the NIW, what it is saying is that this person's skill and their skillset background and what they can contribute to the United States in the future is so prevalently important that we should weigh the requirement of every job offer, which means that we also do not have to do a labor certification. It's potentially the same thing as an EB-1, EB-1A, but instead of approving your own acumen as one of the best in the world in your field, you're just saying that what you happen to do is worthy of being let in the United States with a green card, regardless of a job offer or not, and with no labor certification, which in this case, we have a lot of information out there directly from the administration that adjudicates these petitions that what you do is very important. And that's the reason why we consider the EB-2 National Interest Waiver to be the best option in this circumstance, besides applying for both at the same time. Hope you and others out there find this very helpful.",,,,,

My name is Sherrod Seward, and I'm an attorney that specializes in P-101 and EB-1A visas for some of the best athletes, entertainers, and professionals in the world in the extra ability visa categories. And at this time, we're talking about something that comes up a lot with people that want to transition to permanent residence, a green card, in the United States under the EB-1A category. the eb-1a category is very attractive to people that have a lot of accomplishments because they don't need a job offer and they also don't need to be sponsored in order to use this category to get permanent residence but the thing to know is that it's one track to be on an immigrant path which means it comes with a green card and it's another track to be on your non-immigrant part which just comes with work authorization In this particular circumstance, we have a student that's on F1 but also happens to be a bad, bad man when it comes to being a race car driver, having won multiple international championships and has been ranked in the top of the world three times when it comes to motorsports. So the question is, can they transition directly to the EB1A? And the answer is yes, it is possible, but it's risky. Why? Because if you apply for the EB1A, everything is fine. It gets approved. but we highly recommend that anyone pursuing the eb-1a also pursue a non-immigrant track even do the non-immigrant track first just so if there's something that happens with the eb-1a process that they are not accruing unlawful presence because the eb-1a doesn't come with lawful presence you have to kind of wait until you get approved for that to come through and be fine or even with your work authorization For that reason, we always advocate that somebody that is in the country, in the United States, and wants to stay, apply for an O-1 first, because we can do it to where you get a lot of the same work authorization, but you also have none of the risk of something going wrong with the EB-1A. now we are not saying that a person that's uh good for an o1a is not always good for an eb1a the thing is as responsible attorneys we know that we're not the ones that press the button and sometimes you get officers that don't know what they're doing and you get officers that are having a bad day but we do not want to that to affect the full life of somebody being able to enjoy themselves with work authorization or permanent residence in the united states that's the reason why we advocate get the o1a visa first or the o1b depending on your acumen your accomplishments and history and then when it's uh settled and all set then work on your ev1a application a lot of times we're willing to do a discount on the ev1a because The arguments we make for both are very similar, but that goes on a case-by-case basis. But that is the most responsible way to pursue the situation where you're graduating on an F1, want to go to EB1A, but you are going to stay in the United States. It's best to go for that O1A first because it will keep you in status regardless of the impact. a result of the EB1A. And it also lets you know where you are as far as how strong your arguments are. Because the O1A and EB1A have very similar arguments, but it's just the EB1A tends to be adjudicated more strictly. So if you can get an O1A, you know that you're very, very on a great path on being eligible for the EB1A. Hope that's helpful for all your motorsports drivers and athletes out there. Appreciate you guys.",,,,,

This is attorney Sherrod Seward. If you don't know already, I'm a specialist in O1, P1 and EB1A visas for a lot of sports athletes and professionals from all over the world. Today, we are talking about one of my favorite industries, which is motorsports, not just the drivers, but the professionals that help it go where it needs to go. In this particular case, we have a Canadian, which is important because they want to know if they can use an O-1 or a TN visa to come and do their bidding in the United States as a mechanic for World of Outlaws League. So their current situation is that they want to stay an independent contractor so they can work with multiple teams. so in this case the tn visa is probably not going to be appropriate because the tn is based on a job offer a single job offer and it'd be highly unusual for that job offer to come from multiple employers now it could be the case that you can potentially get two tn visas that you can get one offer come into the country through that work for that employer and then when you're ready to change go back and do the consular processing or the border processing with the new TN visa for the second employer. But if you're in the middle of the season, that's going to be highly, highly inconvenient and probably not good for the employers to work with. So that's why in this case, we consider the 01 visa to be more appropriate because using the o1 structured properly you can do us agent for multiple employers and even freelance gigs so using the same o1 visa this auto mechanic well let's call him for real he is a world-class motorsports fanatic awesome mechanic will be able to use the same visa and one, use it for the first employer, the second employer, and even use it for his freelance activities that he does on his own if it's structured properly. So in this case, whether you're looking at the T1, the TN visa, or the O1 visa, it's going to be the O1 visa that's most appropriate for this situation. If you have any questions about motorsports, whether you're a racer or a professional that works on the cars, don't hesitate to come where we know best. Thank you very much. Thank you.",,,,,

My name is Sherrod Seward, and I'm an immigration attorney that specializes in visas for influencers, athletes, and entertainers from all around the world. Today, I am talking about O1 visas for influencers such as Twitch streamers, YouTube influencers, TikTok, and also Instagram. A lot of times when we do these visas, there's a question of how do we fulfill their itinerary, which means the list of activities they will do in the United States, since the majority of what they're considered to do is online. So there's the argument of, well, why does someone need to be in the United States to do these activities? And that's what I'm talking about today. So people in this space know that it's pretty complicated. common knowledge to know that and how this is done. But USCIS sometimes isn't so smart. So we need to break this down in ways that articulate to them clearly why someone that posts images on the internet or videos on the internet needs to be United States and some tips and tricks of what to put in your itinerary not to confuse them or creating issues where your visa will get denied. Because even if you are extremely accomplished, you can still have a visa denied if they don't think your itinerary is up to par. So the first thing is to explain to them that the images posted come from places that can be in the United States. So if you are an influencer that does a lot of in-place tournaments, so if you are a lifestyle person and you you model for Fashion Nova, you're probably taking pictures all across the world with different type of venues and stuff like that. So that way you can articulate to them that I partner up with certain venues and I have venues in the United States to where we need to grow our United States market base, both me as a entrepreneur influencer and the partner places that I work with. The second part is a lot of influencers are also consultants for other people and do brand development as opposed to just their own. So one of the great things that you can put in your itinerary is hello. Not only do I put my own images up, but I also use my acumen and know how and influence to help other people in the United States create brand and content for them. And one of the things that we do is we have a talent agency that will sponsor, will serve as petitioner for various influencers. And what we will include in the itinerary is stuff for us. Like as part as working with us, you'll have an in-kind obligation to help develop brand marketing, do a couple of posts per week, have strategy sessions, things that we can do in the United States. And then we'll also articulate why those things cannot necessarily be done over Zoom. So we'll say we need to do some of these on location. You have certain type of techniques that you use when you do things on site. And also you can be developing co-branded things such as Um, co-marketing pieces say like, Hey, we're going to be making an ebook together that explains our process on making, uh, content. And that's something that we need to do face to face, just like any other job, because technically if you're not doing like a physical competition, or if you're not doing like a showing up at an event to do some acting, it's always the presumption that some of this can be done on zoom. but it's up to the petitioner and the articulation in that to show the importance of the human interaction, on-site visitation, and the community creative experience that goes into influencing and content creating. So that's how we tackle why influencers, streamers, and brand creatives need to be in the United States to interact with their clients and also have the best product for themselves. when advertising and doing activations that require physical presence in the United States. Thank you very much.",,,,,

Let's see, consolidate bundle. We'll go to solicitation. All right. So those are the options that we want. We want veterans affair, solicitation, these two set asides, contract award details. So under 1 million. All right, so we have 100 results. And what we're looking for is things that are not construction, but things that are things you can buy.

Nope, we're not gonna construct anything. Janitorial services. We're not gonna do that. Construct a facility. We're not gonna do that. Switch gear electrical testing. Small stream sterilizers. We like this one. So open that link in a new tab. Selective replacements. Now see it says labor. We're looking for things that are just tangible items that you can sell. So you have to install that. Staffing service. Replace, upgrade chilled water system. Most of these seem to be a lot of items. Let's increase our items per page. But you see there might not be a lot of responsive things and that's fine. So we're just going through, see this one, remove tile flooring. We can't do that. Bulk liquid rental and delivery. So this bulk liquid oxygen tank rental and delivery, this is one that we can look into. So put that to the side. Sosonite ultrasound. I think that's one that we can look into because it's not a service. This is cemetery furniture. Like that. Thyroid uptake system for San Juan. I just waste removal ground maintenance note janitorial services, a call system services. This is construction oven utilities. That's construction. Grease is cleaning this stuff. Inspections note. See us building stuff. Maintenance maintenance. Trash composter box. That might be one we're interested in. Correct electrical deficiencies. Nope. That's construction. Replace roofs to flashing. Construction. Walk of mat cleaning and rental. We can do like rentals. Grass seed, we like that. Repair, we don't like that. Movable food pantry, I'm not so sure, but maybe. I mean, that's one worth looking at. If they just need a pantry that's movable, we can do that. Hazardous waste removal. Okay, general building request cleaning note. Staffing service. Uninvited building, we don't like that. That looks potentially like something we could do. Extract excavator. So that's a vehicle that they're looking for. Sorry. Water testing, courier service. All right. So what you would do is just do that search every day and then get it. Now let's get the information that we want to put in. So let's make a Google sheet. All right, so I'm going to make a new spreadsheet. I'm a bit frustrated with you. Sorry. Oh. Oh. All right. Sorry about that. Had to go. All right. So, let's see if we got the solicitation. General information. All right. Gas is liquified. Okay. So, look. This is what we really want to know. Secondary point of contact, right? So, we're going to look on. Let's see what type of information is important to us. So one, we want this, the notice type, notice ID, which is right here. So we got, first we want the date, date due. Description. Notice ID. Point of contact name. Point of contact email. I think you can call them. Yeah. email to And I'm probably do the same thing. Oh, I just email one. Then we would definitely want the NASIX code. Product service code. It's okay. I want the location officers, location of service. So this location is where they are. This is where the item will happen, like where the location of the contract will happen. This is product service code. This is NASIX code. Now, like we'll go with that. Now, I'll show you. How to go about doing this. Bids due. Bids due are June 28th, 3 p.m. So that's what goes in the bid due. Boom. Description is this. Boom. Notice ID is right here. Boom. Point of contact one. Amanda lucky. So you put her email there and can be like Amanda. Lucky. Next one is Thomas Nichols. Oh sorry. So where this says their office, they're located here. You take this address. One freedom way. That's where they are. Okay, so we're going to redo that and make sure it's all in one line. Oh, location of service. Place of service is Columbia, South Carolina. product or service code. That's right here. Next code is right here. Now, ideally what we want a person to do is to be able to go look at the bids find somebody to do this and then get the contract. But that's not what we're doing here. But the other part of the job would be, and that's where I want it to stop. Just go through these contracts and put all that information there. Then I'm going to show you what happens with the next step. The next step is this. And then Thomas Nichols. All right. And then let me grab the information we need. Oops, wrong place. All right. So then you go like this here, Amanda. Okay. conversations and then you send it all right and that's kind of what that is so with these I can even probably get these together so that you know the person can see it but you make the login then populate the spreadsheet make it look better with that information and um Excited to get to work on this.

No, that's not it. Settings, Website. Okay, domains, email, selling, brand, marketing. Pixel, metal, share buttons. Maybe it's in developer goals. URL mapping. Oh, well, that's really easy, isn't it? Developer API keys. Send marketing. I really wish they would have made this easier. I don't know where to put it. Looks like you ought to do it. Leave me a chat. Yeah. I can't find it. No. Let's generate API key. All right, so I'll let you figure that out, but you'll see what the problem is. The problem is the new playbook on SmithAI chat box is not uploading into the website. just try this one more time this is not going to help us because it's going to pull up the old conversation thanks your message was sent all right so that's the problem I hope that you can figure it out",,,,,
"June.17,2024",Sherrod on changes to email accounts,Other Video,Sherrod on changes to email accounts,Sherrod on changes to email accounts.mp4,Sherrod on changes to email accounts.mp3,"et me see great morning or afternoon depending on your location in the world wherever that is just know that you're very appreciated I'm making this video because there's some changes that are coming at the firm with um structure and also um technical side of things which is the part that I'm talking about today namely there has been changes to the way that the emails is emails for everyone are housed and presented We used to have a lot more Google workspaces, which would mean why you would need to log into multiple places or a different place than you are now to access your email. All of the emails except for the ompvisas.com domain are now moved to the same one. And for all intents and purposes, the main email domain we're going to use now going forward is Sherrod Sports Visas. If you happen to be working on a project that's for innovative global talent or for some of the other agencies that we have out there or domain names, all you have to do is toggle who you're sending the email from to get that signature block. So I'm going to share my screen and show you exactly what I am referring to. So I'm going to add my screen to the stage. All right, so this is like the back end of what my email looks like. So here you see that there's a lot of domains put to this back end. Now, right now it says that the primary domain is sharedsewardlaw.com. That's going to change. We're going to change to the primary domain being sharedsportsvisa.com. That's because that's primarily where our customers come from. And so we want to send out emails under Shared Sports Visas when it's about Shared Sports Visas. And I'll show you how to do this. So here's an example of an email. And if you want to toggle, you can go to share to sportsviz.com and it switches it to right there. And you should have a email signature block right there too. And so for example, if you're sending something out under innovative global talent, I don't have it showing for mine. So I have to talk to John Lee about it. So if you need a domain and it's not there, Let me know so I can talk to John Lee about that, because this one should have innovative global talent and things of that nature. And the reason I know that is because I know I saw it in the list. Yeah, so you see this innovativeglobaltalent.com? That should be the case that I should be able to toggle this and send it there. Let me see if there's something I just need to reset. Reload. Right. So in time being, if you need an email address and you cannot find it here, let me and John John Lee know so that we can get that rectified because right now I need access to innovative global talent and can't get there and innovative tech dev. But I'm sure John Lee will get that together as soon as possible. So that's just the announcement I have about the emails. If you have questions, just email myself and John Lee and we'll try to get that together. Thank you.",,,,,

"June.08,2024",Innovative Global Talent Agency - Foreign National Worker Services,Immigration Non-Sports,Innovative Global Talent Agency - Foreign National Worker Services,Innovative Global Talent Agency - Foreign National Worker Services.mp4,Innovative Global Talent Agency - Foreign National Worker Services.mp3,"Hello, my name is attorney Sherrod Seward, and I am, of course, an immigration attorney by trade. But now I am a basically in the recruitment and talent business where we're using our acumen and doing primarily and only 01 visas that we learned in the sports industry to now use this as a solution for employers, especially those of in the computer sciences, data sciences and, of course, artificial intelligence categories to where we've also acquired acumen in obtaining the one visas. And it just came to us to where we kind of wanted to do something else other than practice immigration law directly. And we saw an opportunity to use our skill set probably even better in a way that we prefer doing it on the talent agency basis. So one of the primary functions where we see that we are helpful to employers is helping recycle the talent that is lost every year through the H-1B process, where, of course, there's going to be hundreds of thousands of people that have great skill sets and have already been picked up by employers that they want to employee, but won't get the visas due to the cap. And so what the main one of the main primary functions of our service is that we work with employers on a subscription basis as opposed to a retainer that most talent agencies would do to set up what's called the multiple employer using a U.S. agent structure for the one visa. What this means is under the O-1 visa is very common, especially in combat sports and motion pictures and some of the more artistic industries for there to be an agent that serves as the petitioner for the visa and then have arrangements with different projects that the talent will actually work for. We're kind of taking this and using it in a more traditional industry sense. So the subscription service serves to replicate what it'd be like to have different projects for an actor or different competitions for an athlete. So by doing the subscription, it makes it contemplated to USCIS that talent acquired by us and petitioned by us for O-1 visas do in fact have a high likelihood of doing projects with the companies that are paying a retainer. and saying that they are open to that talent working for them. This is especially true for talent that has previously been applied an H-1B visa for because we can show USCIS that there was a previous relationship there with the employer and we're just working to cycle them back. So in a nutshell, our employers can let us know what type of candidates they're interested in and also candidates they have already tried to apply for visas for, bring them to us. Our team will go and use what we know to identify the top ones that would be ideal for the O-1 visa category and take care of that on our own expense, thus making the talent available backed for hire with the employer if they want to. And of course, if an employer subscriber customer brings a talent to us, they get first right of refusal for a certain amount of time to go ahead and have direct interaction with that client. before they are made available to the general pool of customers that we have. We also do direct recruitment all around the world in the industries and talent profiles that our customers let us know they're important to them. So we keep a steady pool of applicants and foreign nationals with work authorization that are already ready to go with our customer partners. In addition, we work closely with immigration lawyers that used to be our colleagues and now are just friends in the game. And we like to have mutual clients. So we enjoy working with other law firms that may be customers of our subscribed customers to get the information we need from each of the talent that they're interested in to get them recycled under that new visa category and sent back. Working with us is we like to keep it pretty easy and transparent. There's a couple, well, really only two levels that we do business at. One is for startups, which is for companies that have 25 employees or less. And then there are the enterprise slash investor tier, which costs more. So the startup level subscription is $1,000 per month. And the enterprise level subscription is ten thousand dollars per month, which, of course, is comparable with what would be paid for retainer for a recruitment agency. But instead, this is not done on a per project basis. This is the ongoing subscription that allows us to have the multiple employer for U.S. agent structure that allows the whole thing to happen in the first place. Then there we do have options for clients to make additional requests before specific candidates. Like, for example, if you give us a bunch of candidates, but you find someone else that you really want to cycle through us, then you can pay a fee there to have us fast track them and look to see if they're good. Now, if we look and we see that they're not a good fit for us, then there is no charge for that. It's only if we do take them on. through our application process and onboard them as a talent with innovative global talent agency. Other than that, we have our kind of standard rates that we do on the talent side of things. Once things are finalized and you do choose to hire one of the talents that's come through us for direct employment, we look for 30% of the first year salary. 20% is due when the talent is hired and then the rest is due 45 days after everybody is happy. If everybody's not happy, then that just stops right there. Now for contract employment, we do 30% rate of the contracted rate. I hope that you find great value in this service. It's something we're very excited about, and we already are making people very happy. So with that being said, I hope you find us in good spirits, and we look forward to working with you. Thank you very much.",,,,,

I'm an intake attorney at Sherrod sports visas and also innovative immigration law. And we're responding to your inquiry about, uh, being a referee and looking to come to United States to do your, uh, craft. Um, so I'm just gonna share my screen and, uh, you shared your LinkedIn with us. Thank you very much for doing that. It's very helpful. And I can see that you are very smart neuroscience graduate Oxford university. OK, so right here as a foil fencer and a silver medalist at the Commonwealth Games, you're already well qualified for what we would do is we do the title as a fencing professional, not necessarily just a competitor. So that way you can use both the accolades of your fencing career competitively, then also what you've done as far as refereeing. And then in refereeing in British fencing, we can see that you've done multiple international cadet level and junior worldwide cup level. So between your fencing accomplishments, competitively and also already being very active looks for the past 14 years at the top level. British looks like for the top level of British and foil and then the international The international stops you have, well, you're very well qualified to get the O-1 visa, which is the most appropriate if you're going to come to the United States and be getting paid. If you're not getting paid for these refereeing opportunities, then you can use the visitor visa or even ESTA. But if you are getting paid, you'll have to do the O-1 visa. It lasts for three years, comes with great work authorization. So, you know, we can pack in whatever you want to do with you want to do. seminars, if you want to produce content on it, any way that you think of producing revenue as a fencer or a fencing professional, we can put that into the petition. The next thing to know is that you will need a petitioner to sign off on your visa petitions. That can be any US citizen or US company. If you do not have one, we do have a company that we work with, Innovative Global Talent. So they will serve as your petitioner, and they will also actively maybe try to find opportunities for you to participate in if you do not have them already. And this is something that helps get the visa petitions across the hump, because sometimes USCIS can be pretty tough petitions that do not have an itinerary or some type of agent involved that's going to be trying to find opportunities for you to do if you do not have them yourself. So I hope you find this evaluation helpful and we look forward to working with you in the near future. Have a great day.",,,,,

I was following up on the EB1A application for Mr. Ivano. Thank you, Parle Francais. I see that you're with KPMG France. But I was just going back over some of our files of clients that we thought were great for the visa category they were seeking. And I'm going to go ahead and share the screen so you can see what I'm looking at as well from what you shared with us earlier. So here right now, the resume is absolutely impeccable, especially with playing in so many national team placements. I think that's what's going to be what presses over the top. So it's really going to be the international championships that do it. The national championships will be will be better if there's international media from more than France that covers this. This individual award would be helpful, but it's really here in an international championships where we will get the best bang for the buck when it comes to the EB1A. And I also want to say that I appreciate you putting together such a good package already. Even with the letters, it's something that we would want to rewrite just so it includes a lot of the special kind of phrases we use to highlight and get the categories that we want. USCIS can be pretty aggressive when it comes to really establishing the quality of the evidence. And that's something that we use the letters for. is to fill in those gaps to show the context of why these are so important. But I can tell that you did definitely painstakingly go through this and get us far and away. So I'm going to actually ask that the team gives a little bit of a discount for you. Usually the EB1As or 10,000 of them get back to you with a discount of 2,000 just for how organized that you are. And this is great too. First team all conference. That helps too. So yeah, this is great. Great candidate for the EB1A. I'll have the team go ahead and confirm that discount for him of $2,000 on the legal fees. And we look forward to working with you. Thank you very much.",,,,,
"June.07,2024",O-1 Visas for Basketball players,Immigration Sports,O-1 Visas for Basketball players,O-1 Visas for Basketball players.mp4,O-1 Visas for Basketball players.mp3,"How's it going? This is immigration attorney Sherrod Seward briefly talking about visa options for professional basketball players that are looking to use their basketball talents in the United States. but do not currently have a position on a major team. If you're not in the NBA or overtime elite or something like that, it's going to probably be very difficult to have a P1 visa while you're not actively on a roster. So typically for basketball players that play at a high level, we look to do O1 visas, which is for foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities. And the reason why we do this is because you do not need to have a current team or competitions you're playing in. It's perfectly fine to have an 01 visa and not compete at all. But at the same time, it keeps you eligible to play in professional basketball opportunities as they come up. And we've done this for numerous basketball players that have played at the national team level. And so I just want to share my screen and give a kind of account of what we're talking about here. So here This kind of talks about what are the options for visas for professional and amateur basketball players looking to play in leagues. It's usually the NBA or the WNBA. And one thing we like to base this off of, and we've been very successful, is doing this for people that have competed with the national team. The national team selection we can use to show employment in a critical capacity. We can use it to show memberships and prestigious organizations. We can use it to show remuneration if there's some good payment that came with it. And we can also use it to show significant awards as being like, it's an award to be a part of the national team. And this particular case, we're looking at a basketball player from Nigeria that has two. well-documented national team appearances for the African World Cup qualifier and African FIBA League. So just using this alone, even though the team came in eighth place and there might not have been a lot of contribution here, just being selected alone usually is enough to support the O-1 visa for a basketball player in our experience. So this person is getting confirmed as we think they're a great candidate for the O-1 and we look forward to working with them.",,,,,

So I'm going to share my screen so you can see the intake with me. OK, so I have his intake up. I see that he's a student at university of Oregon. So that's already good for, um, one of the, uh, cat criterions of the P one, which is to have you competed with an NCAA level, um, organization. Um, I see that he's with the Norwegian golf Federation, although. Born in Singapore. Very interesting background. So what would be good to know is if with the Norwegian Golf Federation, he had any amateur, even if it's junior national tournaments that he participated in. And if he won any, that'd be great. Let's confirm the international ranking. The world amateur golf rankings are pretty good, strong to be used for the P1, especially if they are in the top 300. So yeah, we can see the top 97 rank. Got some great finishes. This confirms that he's been competing with the Oregon Ducks. Oh, and this is great here too. The European Amateur Championships. That helps show national team experience. Or we can argue that it is a national team experience. Okay, so that's pretty good too. Let's keep going. We'll just run, the name through. Okay. I just want to see what type of coverage there is out there. So we got New York Post. That's great. Golf.com. Golf Week. Sorry about this injury that he sustained. NBC Sports. So all of these, I know it's unfortunate that he had this injury, but the publications about him will actually end up being very, very helpful in the P1 petition for them. And then maybe even if you get back to me and say he has a lot of international, like junior national, like championships like that, that might be... cause for an O-1 visa, but I would say that he's definitely a great candidate for the P-1 visa, and I'll have the team follow up with next steps, and we look forward to get started. Just wanna see. Showing any type of, I just went to IMG Academy, this great school in Florida. And, Okay. Yep. Great candidate for P1 and we look forward to working with you.",,,,,

All right. That's okay, but probably not helpful for the 01. Okay, so you're part of the Gwinnett College. Okay, now this is great. The NAIA championship. That is something that's gonna be very helpful for an 01 petition, especially as a coach, because we can use that as comparable evidence as an award as if you want it yourself. And hopefully there's, and I know there's already a lot of coverage over it, so that should be pretty good. Certification is good. Okay, so this we can use as original contributions you're filming. Pass here. OK, so that's good for remuneration right here where you want 100,000. So this can be used as judging others. All right, and this we can use for employment and critical capacity so you don't have to be actually employed by them yet. You can be in the works of being employed by them and that worked pretty good. So, yeah, we've done a lot more with a lot less. I say that you're a great candidate for the 01.

This particular fighter has a visa that's expired 2023. And there are things that we can do about that to, um, to get it rectified. All right. So I'm going to, uh, kind of give evaluation of their situation. right so for fighters we usually put them in o1 or p1 um a lot of times if we can we put them in o1 if they've had a world championship fight or national team experience because there's certain things they can do on that that they can't do on the p1 especially if they don't have fights already lined up um so let's go ahead and look up their box rec OK, so one thing we like to see is definitely an international ranking above 300 is great. So here the boxers rate rated 64 in their weight class. We see that they've already fought in the United States. Let's see. You can see who the promoter was. Larry Goldberg. boxer insider promotions. Okay. I'm not familiar with him, but it is good that he's already had a P1 and has been doing his thing. Okay. So here we have a world championships. Well, an international super light. Looks like he lost that particular championship, but he did win one here. So he does have a title belt with international significance that we can use so the he's definitely great for a p1 obviously he's already had one before but we just like to reconfirm so he's got the ranking and he has a championship um under his belt and body of work so the next thing we need to look at and I bring myself is what are we going to do about the expiration part um whereas visa uh expired well one thing we need to do is address it quickly and sooner than later and what we do a lot of times is we'll say and it's true that there's a miscommunication between the fighter and his promoter especially when there's a change and a lot of times the fighters under profession uh the assumption that the promoter is taking care of their visa work and there's no problems there and they don't let it last and a lot of times we find out that there's indeed a problem later on. So I'm going to reshare my screen to show what we do about this. So over here, I did a Google search, no proncton argument, and we come up at the top of it. But basically what we do is when we submit the petition, we're also gonna make an argument that shows reasons why that the person was unable to address the expiration status during their time. Likely you really wanna do this when it's under six months, but we do have a proven record of getting this rectified even beyond two years when there's been a discrepancy there. And so that's the same thing we'd like to do in this argument. So the P1, uh, has its own fees. And then usually for the non pro talk argument, it costs another 1000 for that, uh, to go in, but it's absolutely necessary in this case so that he doesn't have any lapses in his work authorization. And the worst case scenario, if it's not, um, approved one is if you're in the country and you happen to have a work visa already there, it helps if there's ever a removal defense, worst case scenario, then also, um, Even if the change of status is denied, meaning that they do not approve the non-proton argument, he still can be approved for the P1 visa and go try the consular process and come back in. Although in this case, it might be very dangerous thing to do and probably want the boxer to stay in the United States because if they're not granted that waiver, even though it's very possible they can get one, they will be stuck outside the United States and probably subjected to a ban of some time. So that's my evaluation. I hope that you get this well. The team will take care of you from here on out, but I think they can do regular processing with a non-protect argument and the team will share the fees. Thank you very much.",,,,,

So these, the memberships might be a little bit tough to do for the EB1A just because of the requirements of being part of these, maybe not as stringent as we would like for the EB1A. See.

Um, although like, you know, you're pretty good for like, for both of them, I think it's just so straightforward right now with, um, the Biden administration, if you do it quickly before they really change over that you can get, um, some great, great options and feedback from USCIS using the EB2 category. And this is something that we actually even wrote about. Let me see. Biden, um, innovative immigration law. Let's see how good our Google's going. Let's try it on PVs. AI. Da, da, da, da. Right, so this is actually a letter that we wrote to the Biden National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee. And it's our way of simplifying things where we're talking about the E01, EB1A categories. But right now under for the EB1A, It's a little bit tougher than the EB2 national interest waiver in your case. And you don't need a job offer to do the EB2 under this category. And as you said, it is looking current under EB2 for the priority dates. So I think that this would be the best option for you and other people that are in your kind of circumstance where you're in AI, not necessarily have the best way to prove that you're one of the best AI persons in the world. just because of the nature of the business, not having to do with your skill set. And I think it looks pretty good. We actually have another way that we help clients bolster their productivity and also make them available to job opportunities. Let me see. Global tech. this is an organization um that we're affiliate affiliated with innovative global talent agency oh or maybe it's not innovative there we go innovative tech dev agency so this is a company that can help bolster your ability to get the EB1 or the EB2. What it does is this is a company that has projects that we have people with the skill set to participate in. And these projects are designed to help bolster their profile of what type of projects, original projects they have contributed to that make an impact in the market. For example, right now we're making a lot of tools that help immigration lawyers do their job better. and faster, which of course has a great impact in the industry. And then also, we have a pipeline of employers that are always looking for talent that are coming through this program to look for hiring. And that also leads to opportunity to get more feedback from experts in the field if you need more letters. So what I would highly suggest is doing the EB2 national interest waiver and maybe doing it quickly while the Biden administration is still in power. And then also maybe looking at participating in the innovative tech dev agency program to where you would be working on projects that they come up with. for the purpose of bolstering your immigration petition with original projects that would be very advantageous to the program. So that being said, I hope you appreciate this complimentary evaluation. And we think that you're much better for the EB2 national interest waiver while the Biden administration is still in power and looking at using innovative tech agency to do some original projects to bolster your application. Thank you very much.",,,,,

This is talent-based immigration lawyer, Sherrod Seward with Innovative Immigration Law. And I am flabbergasted, just as shocked as everyone else, the United States cricket team has indeed defeated the mighty Pakistan cricket team in the World Cup of T20. And over the past couple of years, we've been heavily involved in doing visa visas for some of the best cricket players of the past decade. And I can say that I don't think any of them ended up on the United States team, while plenty of them ended up on the Pakistan team. And it's just truly an amazing feat that I think no one expected, including me. You know, as far as Pakistani players go, we've got a list right here. We've done Jeevan Mendes, Shahid Afridi, Mizbel Al-Haq, Abdul Rahman, Mohamed Hafiz, Cameron Akmal. We became very, very familiar with Pakistani cricket players and just how it's woven into the fabrics. how that con the country operates so for the united states team from which I hear has a lot of people with full-time jobs a lot of iot professionals to come in and get such an amazing victory is uh something that's probably shocking the world in my and frankly making a lot of people upset uh today all over the cricket world and you know a lot of people happy too but it just goes to show you that what a beautiful game this is and how people can come together to do major things that we thought was impossible. But here at Shared Sports Visas Innovative Immigration Law, we're going to continue to keep our eye on cricket and providing some of the best immigration advice out there for both cricket players and enthusiasts. and business professionals to come to United States under Visitors B1, Athletic P1, and Entrepreneurial O1 visas. So look out for the T10 Masters League that I hear is coming out in October. We're getting ready to start that season up with the visas there. And we're always available to help professionals come for the minor league and the major league cricket seasons that are upcoming as well. United States, there you have it, and I cannot believe it.

"June.07,2024",Priority 3 _IIL_ - P-3 Visa for Culinary Arts,Immigration Non-Sports,Priority 3 _IIL_ - P-3 Visa for Culinary Arts,Priority 3 _IIL_ - P-3 Visa for Culinary Arts.mp4,Priority 3 _IIL_ - P-3 Visa for Culinary Arts.mp3,"Hello, this is attorney Sherrod Seward with Innovative Immigration Law. And today I'm discussing options for culinary professionals in certain kind of circumstances. In this circumstance, we're talking about someone who is not necessarily a world renowned chef, is from India, but has permanent residence in Canada. And the question is, what is the best visa type for this category? As most people know, the O1 category is most appropriate for people that have risen to the top of their field. In the culinary arts, this is often chefs who have received rewards for their work or have worked closely with restaurants who have won international awards for their work. But it can be pretty difficult climb if it's somebody that just has worked kind of behind the scenes and some pretty good jobs, but nothing that's considered world class. This is common for people that work on cruise ships or on resorts and things of that nature, as opposed to persons that work in Michelin level restaurants and high end restaurants that are covered regularly, regularly on news coverage and things of that. So in that case, probably the 01 is not the safest bet. It's not to say that people cannot get it. It's just an upward climb to kind of show why their skill set, why their experience was so important to be risen there, because a lot of the information out there won't be necessarily about them. There have to be a lot of work that goes into the context of why that's appropriate. The next thing we would look at is if they are a Canadian or permanent resident, they might be eligible for the TN visa. So I'm just gonna share my screen right now to show what's going there. So here's a list of the professions that are eligible for the TN visa. Of those that'd be good for a culinary person is hotel manager, but this really deals with not just cooking, but overall management of the business. There would be nutritionists, which should be in here somewhere, nutritionists, but they'd have to have a bachelor's degree in nutrition and also a dietician. So these are more looking at on the doctor kind of health side of things as opposed to the taste side of things. And that's why we think that this one and all of the other kind of professions out there under the TN visa are not appropriate in this case. In this case, probably would be the best straightforward is to use the P3 visa. The P3 visas are for individuals or groups of people that do something that's culturally unique and that can be proven that it's culturally unique to come to the United States So if someone is very good at cooking native Indian dishes, it's even better if it's a subset of Indian dishes that they have really training in, or if they have previous experience that can be documented and making those type of foods could be very advantageous. Unfortunately, the P3s are only good for one year at a time, but if you're looking at bringing somebody quick, and getting them right to work is really the only option there besides the O1 and the TEN that can get them here quick enough with that work authorization. But under these circumstances where someone is not necessarily world renowned, but they do have a culinary experience that is culturally unique, and they also don't qualify for any of the TEN professions, the P3 is the way to go. And it is for one year, but it can be renewed uh for multiple years and why are the persons doing that they can be working on something more robust like a green card under the eb2 or eb3 category depending on what their educational requirements were so that is my suggestion in this circumstance is that the p3 visa is the best for culinary arts that are not world renowned and do not qualify for a tm visa thank you very much",,,,,

Let's do this. Pamela, this is a very important task for you. I need you to gather contacts for me from MyVisaJobs.com. I'm going to start from the beginning so you can see everything. Let me make sure there's a microphone on. It looks like it is. Okay. So it's MyVisaJobs.com, info at OLG.com. Password is NO. I don't know if you see it. Okay. First thing you do is you go to home. You're going to click attorney. You're going to click top H-one B visa lawyers. Now you see there's two hundred of them. Okay. I want the contacts for all two hundred in this way. You go to Thomas Allen. You know, you'll click them, but you'll have to go to Google and look for them. So you go to Thomas Allen H-one B lawyer. Find him, and then put the following contact information, him, his name, how many LCAs he did, average salary, email, telephone address. I do not want the email that is generic to the website. I want his personal email. So if you've got to get on LinkedIn or whatever, find me his personal email. If there happens to be multiple emails, what you do is you can just make another tab and insert a column to the right, put this email to. uh email to telephone number address state website profile he has a profile and then I want you to put a link this one's going to be a link because when you go to here right when I clicked on his name it brings top H-one-B sponsors by Thomas Allen. Let's see what happens when you do search all. Actually, no, okay, so that didn't work out right for us. So we're just gonna get his top two hundred clients. Okay, so for each of these, I want you to take all his clients for Thomas Allen and go like this. Let's actually make this a sheet. So let's blend spreadsheet. This will be Thomas Allen H clients. So you do tabs and everything. So we got one through fifty here. Go back. Click one through one hundred. figure out a way to paste that. But you'll just paste all these. I'm not that good at that. But go one through two hundred. So go rank one through two hundred and do that. Now when you're done, when you're done doing the list here, what I want you to do is file, share with others. Make sure that anyone with a link can edit. copy the link, then you put that here, tab. Then you go to the next person. So that's carrying, oh, you know what else we need here? We need another column to the right. She put his law firm, Law Offices of Thomas Allen. So when you do Google search, also put their law firm there. So this is Colleen Wagner. Same thing with that here. You can clean this up, like put the tabs and make a claim for me. Then you would Google her. There's an H-I-B lawyer. Let's find out where she's at. She's with Fragomen. So you see she is a partner at Fragomen Del Rey LLP. So that would go here. When we go back, we need to put her LCAs. So that would be her number of LCAs and her average salary. So then you would get her email stuff and her actual email. So she's here on LinkedIn. So you could use that. She's in San Diego, good for her. Get her email from there. And this could also serve as her profile when you start building it out. And then again, we go and grab our clients. So you would make another, like spreadsheet again, you know, new spreadsheet. Karen. And then you would just grab all our clients. American Rugby Investments. So this would go like that. You put them all there. Remember, you go to share. But remember, you would get all her other contacts too. You can go to, does she have two hundred? She doesn't have any of the two hundred range. So you grab all these two. And so she has a lot of one offs. That's cool. Karen is a... Go to share with others. Anyone with link. Can edit. Copy link. And then this would go. Over here. Now do that for all two hundred attorneys and clean this one up. You got it. All right, I'm trusting you to do a very good job with this and it should not take all that long.

And if somebody else is doing this project too, this is a very important and we look forward to your work on this. What we're doing is we have a website that lists the employers and attorneys of people that file for H-B visas. And we're looking to collect the contact information from these employers with specific categories on this job site. the context that we want. First of all, we've done this before. And you see here how this is like Eventbrite, San Francisco, HR Generalist. We're going to make a list that's kind of like that, but it's going to have more context on it. Right. It's going to have more context on it. So the login is info.hw.com and innovative. I'll show it. All right, so now we're in. We're gonna go to home Alright, so let's go through the instructions. So we're going to do a simple search with these selected. We want employers. Alright, so we're going to go to employers. And go to work state. Simple search with these feels connected. Maybe that's not the right one. Oh, right. I think I selected the wrong one. We're going to go to H-B Visa. Go to search. Right here. Here we go. So credit H-B Visa. Go to simple search. Now, we're going to do it by state in a certain order. So here we have the states that we're looking at. And I want them done five contacts each. going through these things. So you North Carolina five, South Carolina five, Ohio, Texas, right? So the first one is North Carolina. We're gonna select this age. So fiscal year, two thousand thirteen. All right, so here's fiscal year, two thousand thirteen. All right. The next one is occupation group, IT math. Occupation group, IT math. Then it says skip, so then you're going to search. Click search. Search. So now we have search on the company, so we're going to be looking over here, right? So we have a lot of results, three hundred and fifty one results. Let's look at the other thing, so it says skip all doctors and hospital people, so we don't want anybody dealing with doctors or hospitals and skip all employers that file less than twenty visas and all So this is going to be maybe where it's tough because as you see on this, on the employers here, these all have more than what we wanted to do. Capital immigration law. Right, so if here you don't see any companies that meet that criteria, then you'll have to kind of look in here. Let's see if there's a way to... Occupation group. One through ten, work city. Simple and quick search. What I want to do is find a way to show this by minimal salary. So I'm gonna go to advanced search, sort by salary. All right, so if that doesn't create good results by going by sorting by employer, we're gonna sort by salary. And we're gonna still go to twenty-three, work state, North Carolina. And I should take it back. So let's go to simple search. So we'll go to fiscal year, two thousand twenty three, sort by salary. Work state is North Carolina. Occupation group is IT math. And that should be what we look for. Okay. Oh, so now we get some better things. So we got Tata, Lowe's. So I'm going to put that in here. Search occupation group. Sort by salary. So that's how we got some companies that list here. So we want five contacts. We got five here, Tata consultancy, Lowe's computer software, stuff like that. So these are good. Now, what we're going to do is find the one that's under five hundred Tata. That's the first one. So here we see that they have a pretty big So this is what we have. Oh, when we go back, it pulls up this. What we want you to do is go to contact, right? And get all of these guys. And that's what will go into the new sheet. And let's see what type of information that we need. So we want all the contact information of all the people that come under this, let's see, under here. So it might be two people, it might be five. We want you to list them with all their job, their titles, their phone number, email. And then we also wanna know how many visas were filed and the law firm name that they work with. And then just keep going with these contacts for each account. And this is the order of getting contacts five by five, right? So I'm gonna go, h-one-b visa simple search occupation group it and math work state you go to which one of your own getting five at a time and just keep going skip industry make sure it's on two thousand twenty three employer you go sort by salary because we want the high salary jobs in here Search jobs. Okay, so then we already did Tata. So the next one would be Lowe's. So you click on Lowe's. Right here you mark what law firms are working with. They're working with Fragment. So then you click here, you go to contacts and you get all of these contacts that are here right here. It looks like it's the, it's the same person. So we can just speak to Donna and get what address she's at too. So I want the address of the person too. Okay. so forth and so forth remember to always get the name of the law firm that they're working with too so the law firm name here is fragelman delray and lowell so this is this is a very important task I know that you are up to it and I believe in you please get on it immediately and like I said you'll get an extra fifty dollars every two weeks maybe even more if you're performing at an optimal level all right thank you very much",,,,,

So I'll give you this, but I'll have some more information that's needed on it too. So I'm going to show you kind of where to start. Let's start looking on this. I'm making big. So you go to H-B Visa, and I'll give you a login. You'll go to simple search. Okay. Now occupational group, you put this on IT and math. fiscal year, you put it, you go rank by salary and then work state to put whatever state is in. So we're starting in North Carolina. So North Carolina be first, go to search jobs. All right. Now what we're looking for, let's get the top. ones over here. Now, one thing you'll see in notes is I do not want, where's that? I want you to skip all doctor and hospital people. So if it looks like the people are in doctors and hospitals, don't do it. I want you to skip employers that have filed less than twenty visas or more. So we don't run these really big ones. So I'm going back to where we were. So the first one we would do is Tata because they have more than two hundred and less than two hundred. So we go to Tata. Tata Services. And we'll see that you see to here now you see this that's the contact we want definitely there now we go to more contacts we get these contacts over here okay make sure you get all their emails and then you want to get the number of certified applications that they did for the top five employers that you find in that category.

"May.31,2024",Sangit,Client Correspondence,Sangit,Sangit.mp4,Sangit.mp3,"Hello, I'm attorney Sherrod Seward of Innovative Immigration Law and Shared Sports Visas, and I was reaching out to you. I saw that you had an inquiry for an O-A visa. Thank you so much for thinking about us. We do a lot of visas in the O category for people in the cricket industry, from players like Suresh Raina all the way up to league owners like Shaji El-Mouk. And one of the great things about the O-one is that it's dual intent. So when you go to the visa interview place, even if you say you plan to never come back to your home country, they cannot deny you because the O-one is dual intent. So the way that the fees work is that the legal fees are ten thousand. And then the petitioner service, if you do not have a petitioner to sign off on your immigration forms, the United States is two thousand. And then there's some additional filing fees, which the options were presented to you. So what we do is we file for the visa on the petitioner service. When it gets approved, then you schedule the interview at the consulate. The consulate stamps your visa with the passport, and they do this for three years at a time. And we're very adept at doing that. So we make great arguments for cricket players. And if you want to move forward, I believe they have already sent you the invoice. So you can just check that out, and the team will get back to you. Thank you very much.",,,,,

I saw that he's ranked sixty seventh in the world right now and the fourth best fighter from his country. So if you guys want to do the P-I visa, we can do that. it's always advantageous to have at least some interest letters from promoters in the United States. In the case that you do not have any of that able to get interest or have a relationship with promoters in the United States, we do have a petitioning agency that can help with that, actively finding vouchers, and they already have interest letters from promoters that can be used to get the visa. There is a charge for that, and then they also have a service that if they play But the first thing is getting the visa. If you do not have a petition in the United States, you can use the talent service.

With the O-B, you have the option of using premium processing to get a decision probably in around a month from USCIS. And also it's dual intent, which means that if he comes to a consulate, what he can't do in Iran, but if he goes and does his interview in Istanbul or somewhere like that, that our team can help arrange, he could say that he does intend to get a permanent residence application green card once he comes to the United States because the O-B is reach out to you, give our confidence in that he is eligible for the O-B.",,,,,

We looked you up and your resources and background available on the Internet, and we have deemed that you are indeed a great candidate for the O-B visa, which is the primary visa that we would do for somebody in your industry. One thing that's great about it is that the O one visa is dual intent. There's a lot of times where people from your region of the world go to get their nonimmigrant visas and they are denied often at the consulate because the consulate might say that you do not have enough ties to your home country. But using the O one visa is no problem because the visa is dual intent. that you do plan to obtain a green card in the United States at your interview and never return, it is fine on these O-B visa and it cannot be denied for that.

Thank you very much.

So at first we thought that the P one visa might be an option until we were told that she'll be doing things other than competing, especially such as getting NIL compensation, which, of course, you can't do on the F one visa and the O. So I just want to reach out to you, make sure that you have this information direct from me that we understand what she's looking to do and that the O-I-A is the best circumstance for her to be able to compete in tennis and also take advantage of those NIL opportunities. And she can also coach and do seminars and things like that on it as well. So I hope this finds you good. Have a great weekend and we look forward to working with you. Thank you very much.",,,,,

I was following up on an inquiry you had about a P-one visa for cricket, specifically with the Orlando Galaxy. We did look it up, confirmed that they are a part of a major minor league league. which means they can take advantage of the Compete Act. So the situation is good that it can support a P-I visa as the competitions are important enough for it to do that. And you don't have to do the O-I visa, which is great. So I'm going to have the team forward the information to you and the invoice. So when you're ready to proceed with your players, I think there's one.

I want to say it's a great time to do the renewal because we think there might be an increase in filing fees coming up soon. One thing we can do now is definitely give a break on the petitioner service since you've been such a great client. One thing I will say is USCIS is getting increasingly, as the years go on, hard on combat sports competition petitions that do not have active fights. So if you do have interest letters from promoters about upcoming fights, that's great. If not, we do have another petitioner service that goes ahead and has memorandum randoms of understanding with a couple of boxing promoters to help full your schedule out for the itinerary. Either way, we do highly suggest that you get started, at least letting us get started with writing the petition, whether you're in the United States or not. It really doesn't matter to us. So if we file the visa now and you leave the United States, it'll already be processing under regular processing. And if it gets approved while you're outside of the United States, we'll just have you either do an interview or an interview waiver and Get it applied to your passport. If you happen to come into the United States while it's pending, we just need to send a form in to let them know so that you can change your status from the old P or B one to the new P one. But, yeah, it doesn't matter if you're in the United States or out. We like to apply as soon as possible so it's already adjudicating, and that way you don't have to use premium processing. And we'll just update them to where you are physically, whether you're inside the United States or out at the correct time. We appreciate your business, and thank you very much. Thank you. you guys may not be married but you get to a point when she don't like you you don't like her and it was year seven you know usually that's the year things go wrong but I liked her I still like her been thirty years now and and I love her but it's important more important to like somebody because you can love anything but when you like something you ain't gonna right so I liked it and i That's so shitty.

I'm contacting you from actually in Belize right now. But I just want to reach out to you. We went over the process. I understand that you want to switch over to the EB-A while you're here in the country. The first step, either way we go about it, is getting the EB-A application done. So I'm giving you the invoice and engagement letter for the legal fees right now so that we can just start writing regardless of the process of if you want to do consular processing or the adjustment of status. I just want to get a head start and having the application ready in case the filing fees are about to go up and save you a little bit of money. OK, so but everything looks good. We're fine doing your application. Definitely have a great career and it's definitely a good time to go for a green card for you. So here's the invoice. If you have any questions, just email the team. I want to prepare the EB-A and then I'll reach out back to you to see and make sure what you want to do about the filing process. If you want to stay in the United States and wait for the advanced parole to come, or if you want to be able to move and travel and come back and forth.

I'm giving you a message from Belize just following up on clients. I see that you're eligible for a renewal. I suggest that you do that sooner than later because there's an issue nowadays with getting the filings in due to some changes at USCIS with filing fees. They have increased and they are targeted to increase even more. So reaching out to clients to say, if you can get going a little bit quicker, especially with regular processing since there might be an increase in the filing fees, maybe even 100%. We are ready to do the renewal for you. For our renewals, we do them at the same price that there already was. And for you, we're willing to forego the petitioner fees. So you do not have to have any petitioner fees. You can just renew at the same price that you did previously, which was $4,000. And then the team will present the new filing fees to you, which were a little bit increased. The other thing I want to put in your purview is USCIS really likes for you to have at least interest in some fights from promoters. If you do not have that, we do have a service that does have a memorandum of understanding with a couple of promoters that can serve as a petitioner. And it definitely gives a leg up when it comes to renewing these PVs nowadays with them being so tough on boxers and actually having an active schedule. But either way, it's a great time to renew your visa sooner than later, and we look forward to working with you. Thank you very much.",,,,,

And what we do is we charge a $30,000 fee for that if you do not want the green card and put you and your family under the 01 category. With that, you can be in and out of the United States for three years at a time, and it is renewable. Also, your spouse and children under 21 can obtain O3 visas, which allows them to be here in the United States. But also they can go to school full time if they want to go to university or take classes. And you do not have to be here, but they can stay full time if they want to. Excellent flexibility.

If you are a person that likes to be in and out of the United States, you do not have to stay here while this is happening. What we would do is file for the O-1 visa, and when you get it, we would file for the EB-1A, but not adjust your status right away. What we would do is wait until it's approved, which you can do pretty quickly with premium processing, and then we would set it up so that you can do an interview for your green card when you're ready. Right. So with the 01 approval, you'll get three years of travel in and out of the United States to do your business. With the EB1A, you can have that approved in another month and a half or two if we use premium processing. From there, we can just use the visa interview times that are available to pick a time that's convenient for you and your family to actually obtain the green card without having to stay in the United States for months at a time if you don't want to.",,,,,

But even with that, we try to mitigate the risk by having a refundable fee schedule in the case that we're not successful. So for one, this is all we do. So we know what we're doing.

And there's no penalties to having previously filed the O-1 because it's dual intent, which means they want people like you to become permanent residents of the United States because we're proving that you're one of the most incredible business persons in your industry or one of the most highly skilled professionals in your industry.

The other thing that's great between the O-1 and the H-1B is it's not tied to a certain employer. We structure it so that you can work for yourself or even for multiple employers in certain circumstances. And here's the kicker. At the consulate, it's perfectly fine to say that you never intend to return back to your home country.

And why is that important? It's because you could save yourself about a million dollars using your business acumen rather than your capital if you want to move to the United States and immigrant. under the permanent resident category, which means you receive a green card. A lot of people are under the impression that the best way to do that is by investing at least a million dollars into the EB-5 program. However, they don't know that there's other things out there that are much quicker much cheaper and much more flexible that are available to them now, which is one, the O-1 visa category, which is for foreign nationals that have extraordinary talents. That doesn't have to be in singing or playing basketball. We do it for business persons all the time and highly skilled professionals. And from there, you can look at the EB-1A category, which does not require a job offer. or a minimum investment to go ahead and transition to the green card while you're in the United States. Using the 01 visa category, you can be in the United States in under two months if everything goes great, which does a lot. And then from there, you can rest in the United States while you have work authorization under 01 and do the EB1A without having to leave and wait for a visa to become available in your country of origin. So again, If you're considering the EB-5 investment category visa to come to the United States for permanent residence, you should inquire about your talent first because it could be easier, quicker, and far more flexible.

"May.25,2024",Innovative Global Talent Agency - Combat Sports Program,Business Development or Marketing,Innovative Global Talent Agency - Combat Sports Program,Innovative Global Talent Agency - Combat Sports Program.mp4,Innovative Global Talent Agency - Combat Sports Program.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward and I'm the Talent Director at Innovative Global Talent Agency. And I'd like to congratulate you if you're seeing this video means that you've been asked if you would like to participate in our combat sports program, which is great for fighters. I'll give some kind of history on why this is such an important thing. In the past, we've had a lot of success on the immigration side, getting fighters that are not signed to major promoters. visas approved without having ties to major promoters. That's no longer the case, and it's getting extremely hard to get visas approved without having some type of relationship or promise to have fights in the near future. This is more prevalent in P1, but it also happens a lot in O1 sometimes. So either way, when we have fighters that we think that have a lot of potential, we like to introduce this program to allow them participate. So one, they can get a good chance at getting fights in the United States and with promoters that are likely to lead them to world championship opportunities. Over the years, we have developed some great relationships with the best combat sports promotions in the United States, and we have commitments from them to always kind of consider certain fighters that are in our purview under the talent agency contract. to have bouts. Now what we do not do is stop athletes from getting their own bouts and managers from getting their own bouts, but this service actively seeks out bouts for them to comply with the immigration requirement that there be actual events that are about to happen. So the talent agency has agreements in place with promoters and with other agents Two, have our fighters that are petitioned for from our agency always considered for upcoming cards, which gets one, bouts if the fighter doesn't have some. And it also is very good for complying with the USCIS rules because we're actively having a paper trail of finding fights for the athletes. So right now, I'll just bring it up and see kind of what's in here. So... This is the agreement that we have in place for combat sports. Now, one, I want to make it very clear that we do not preclude athletes and their talent managers from getting their own fights. This is here in case that we do procure or advise on a placement for a bout. When that happens, the cost for that is 20%. So right here, this is the first thing. This is language that is in there for USCIS to kind of look at. Of course, we try to secure much more than $500 per bout, but this is just in there to show that there will be some kind of compensation every time there is a bout. And here is the filing fee that goes to the petitioner service for serving as a petitioner of the visa. In some cases, this is introduced after this is already paid, so then it's nothing to worry about, but this is just the fee for the application for the talent agency if you're using it and you haven't paid an application fee already or don't have a scholarship on that. These are the stipulations. One is 20% of purse for the bouts, for placing the bouts. And then it's 30% of sponsorship revenue that's actually gotten by IGTA or IGTA partners. So this is that if you bring in your own sponsor, we do not take anything. If you bring in and get your own fights, we don't take anything from that. And the rest of it's pretty much a boilerplate and it's from date of approval lasting three years. And that's the main way of how it works is that there is 20% purse. And of course you do not have to take every fight that's presented to you. It's just that we're actively trying to get things for our athletes to do to comply with immigration services, but you're free to get your own bouts. We do not take any money from that and you're free to get your own sponsorships. So I hope that clears up what it means to be invited to our prestigious combat sports program with Innovative Global Talent Agency. And we look forward to working with you in the future. So you have a great day. Thank you for considering us. And we hopefully look forward very much to working with you in the very near future. Have a great day.",,,,,

"May.23,2024",P-1 - Consultation Letter Requirement Tips & Tricks,Other Video,P-1 - Consultation Letter Requirement Tips & Tricks,P-1 - Consultation Letter Requirement Tips & Tricks.mp4,P-1 - Consultation Letter Requirement Tips & Tricks.mp3,"Hello, this is Sherrod Seward, sports and entertainment immigration attorney. And today I am talking about some nuances with the P1 visa application, namely the requirement for a consultation letter. What is that? A consultation letter can serve kind of two purposes, one and circumstance. It means a letter from the labor association that is associated with the industry that you're in. to get a letter that one says they have no objective objection to the foreign national participating in that particular industry, saying it will not hurt the domestic workforce. Then second is good if it gives accolades to confirm that the candidate has accolades that are worthy of the visa in the first place, basically saying they're good at what they do. And the question comes up a lot that there's a lot of sports, which is most of them, where there is no labor organization. So there's nowhere to get a consultation letter. And if you get an adjudication officer on your case that is unfamiliar with the sport or just being a jerk, they can go ahead and ask for this consultation letter, even when there's no place to get one and ask you to prove that there's no place to get one. And there's a couple of ways to attack this. One is, when is it absolutely necessary and what to do about that? Well, in certain sports such as soccer, football, and basketball, there are the MLS Players Association, the National Basketball Players Association, and the NFL Players Association, where they are labor unions that do issue consultation letters. So you really can't say that there isn't a... a consultation letter, a labor union that doesn't exist. So if you happen to find yourself doing a visa for a player in this realm that's professional and how to get around it, what you say is just ask them for it. And usually they'll either not respond or they'll say, we only do consultation letters for people under contract. And that's enough to show that they want to issue one. A bigger problem comes when they do give you one and it says, yes, this team gives a consultation letter for this player, which will complicate the visa application more if they just said nothing. Right. And other sports, you can be strategic about it. For example, mixed martial arts. There is no. one governing body of the sport, really. And then there is no labor union. And it's easy to document because you can go on Google, Google MMA talent union, and you'll see a lot of articles come up to say why they should have a union, but they don't. But sometimes it can be good to get it from the Federation, a letter from the Federation where the other athlete comes from, because there's a criteria under the P1 eligibility portion that asks is if there is a letter from the governing body of the sport that speaks to the international recognition of the athlete. In that case, you can argue both to like, hey, there's no labor union, but we're introducing this letter from the national governing body of the sport as one of the eligibility criteria. And you can kind of paint a picture, kind of saying it's a consultation letter, even though there's no labor union, just to try to avoid the RFE, and that happens a lot. But the real way around it is to just Google labor union, that sport, kind of screen print the page, also go to the list of organizations that USCIS lists on their website, print that out too, say we didn't find it there, we didn't find in Google. And if there's articles out there that talk about why there's no labor union, you can use that as well. But at the same time, strategically, if there's organizations out there that aren't labor unions, but they're friendly to you and they are credible as far as being a governing body of the sport. You can, one, use that to cover that under the eligibility criteria, but also try to give language like, hey, we're introducing this as a consultation letter just to try to scoot that pass without giving a request for evidence on that application. But either way, that's how we go about it. And I hope that's helpful to you. Always glad to share our information and experience with the industry and the people out there trying to come home. So until next time, have a great one.",,,,,

And then if you added some more information, you can get the full length for P1 would be five years or an O1 would be three years. But these days are different and it's much more challenging. And the first thing is what even constitutes a renewal. Nowadays, everything about the petition needs to be the exact same in order to get the treatment of a renewal. And what that treatment is, is there's regulations out there and suggestions to USCIS that they're supposed to basically give respect to a previous approval that was made under the same circumstances. But if the circumstances are different at all, then they will not. And what are the specifics about what kind of circumstances will be different? One is if you have a change in petitioner, then yes, there will absolutely need to be a new petition. It's not a renewal. If there's a change in the activities that you will be doing, then absolutely. Well, that's not absolutely, but there's a good chance that USCIS will not just adjudicate it as a regular straightforward petition and ask you to provide information so it can be reviewed again. And that's even on some things where like if you're a boxer and you are now fighting on your promoters a little bit different or something like that. or even if your opponents are different, they could still come in and say, hey, we're not going to adhere to the previous adjudication because your itinerary is different. And sometimes things happen to where you are now competing or doing something slightly different than what you were doing when you first did the petition. So if you were a data scientist, but now you're an AI, or if you were a mixed martial artist, but now you're doing bare knuckle boxing. Um, if it's an activity that was outside of what your original job title was when you'd applied. then you absolutely need to do a new petition or they'll adjudicate as a new petition and it won't get the treatment as a renewal, which is much easier in process. So to reiterate, if you're doing a visa renewal and you'll think it'd be a very straightforward process for your immigration attorney, Think again, unless all things are the same, which is your exact activities, job title, and parties involved are the exact same without changes. It is highly likely that USCIS will review the petition as a new petition and everything will have to be redone with bolster arguments under this new environment, which is very strict on visas. So that's why if you go to go get a renewal and your immigration attorney says, This is pretty much a new petition. He or she is almost entirely correct, as there's usually something that changes in these visa categories that would give the leeway for USCIS adjudication officers not to adhere to the previous approval. Sorry to deliver the bad news, but I'm going to tell it to you straight. See you next time.",,,,,

When you do a P or O visa petition, there's a Form I-129 that asks, what do you expect to make as far as compensation? And then it asks, is there any other way to explain it pretty much? Historically, for many years, we would put zero in that box and then the extra explanations say see the information included with the petition. Probably about a year ago, we started seeing pushback on that. Now, what would happen when you say what's going on in the petition and the petition? We would typically express compensation in percentages. For example, a lot of times we're dealing with track athletes, golfers, boxers, MMA fighters that get paid as they compete and by sponsors. And then they have coaches that get paid as the athlete competes. So we'll say they'll be competing in bouts. The athlete will keep at least 80 percent of what the revenue is. And then we might say the coach will receive at least 15 percent. USCIS is pushing back heavily on the expression of compensation just as a percentage. And they say they need to know something more tangible, even though that's not in the rules. No worries. What we've suggested and used in our own practice and in our consultation with other attorneys is using the percentage base and then put a kind of a finite backend. So we'll say they'll receive 80% of their expected revenues from competing or from doing gigs or whatever the activities may be, which is expected to be at least this number. From there, we would take that number and place it on the form. as uh an expression so for example you can say fifty thousand dollars then say see the petition they'll say they're receiving a percentage of what's coming up but it's expected to be at least 50 000. Now, the thing to think about is in your activities, you want to make sure that whatever salary that you're saying or expectation they will make doesn't create a situation where USCIS can say, hey, we're worried about them making less than minimum wage. So while there is typically no wage necessary for an O-1 or P-1 petition at all, if you do put one there, you do need, well, You're going to need probably to avoid scrutiny by making sure that number is bigger than what it appeared to be if it was going to be minimum wage. So if they're working 40 hours a week training in the gym, whatever money that they're getting needs to kind of express that it is more than what the minimum wage is. in the place where they're petitioning. So I hope that is helpful to the folks out there petitioning for P1 and O1 visas. Yes, today's a pure expression of compensation as a percentage may be over for now until somebody litigates and tells them for certain that it's none of their business. Until then, let's give them what they want. Have a great day.",,,,,

This is Sherrod Seward with Innovative Immigration Law and also Sherrod Sports Visas. And when I'm recording this, it's right around graduation time where a lot of the international student athletes and just international students in general are scrambling around to figure out where they're gonna work and how they're going to manage their visa status when it comes to their next steps. This is a time where there's going to be a lot of people trying to take advantage of their OPT. There's going to be people that are waiting to see if they are picked for the lottery for H-B. And there's going to be some incredibly talented individuals that are going to be seeking P-one and O-one visas. And the question is and well, I'm just more kind of giving an update on what's out there is that as we at our law firm transition, a lot of students from the F-one status to P-one or O-one, we're advocating that they do it sooner than later. rather than try to rely on the optical practical training program because uscis is getting more aggressive everywhere and what we're starting to see is more crackdown on them asking if you have maintained the proper amount of work schedule while you were transitioning from the f-one to another visa category. And if they find that you didn't, then that might impact your ability to change status to the P-one or O-one. So imagine if you are in a STEM for some reason, well, not for some reason, because you were incredibly smart and you could go through that type of matriculation and you know that you have quite a long time on OPT and you use that to kind of just bide your time while you're waiting for your old visa to go play sports and you don't get that time in pay stubs and things of that nature while you're doing it you could be at a huge risk of not being able to change your status because it's going to be hard to explain that time in between if you don't have a a paperwork pathway to show that you're properly using your employment that you're going to do on your opt so that's one thing to think about And another reason that if you are considering or are eligible to convert your F-one to a P-one or O-one to do it sooner than later, just so that you have less of a gap of time to explain your OPT should it come up when you try to change status. Hope that's helpful. Have a great day.",,,,,

This is immigration lawyer Sherrod Seward with the innovative immigration law intake team and also shared sports visas drafting team. And we're talking about some nuances about nerdy immigration lawyer stuff. But hopefully somebody out there finds it beneficial. So If you don't know already, O-1 petitions for extraordinary foreign nationals and P-1 petitions for internationally recognized athletes both need someone to sign the I-129 form. Typically, this is an employer that will actually employ the person. For example, if you get drafted to the NBA, then your team will serve as your petitioner slash sponsor to sign the immigration forms which is form I-129 in order to come to the United States on that visa. But there's a lot of times where the employer does not want to do it or there is no employer that makes sense to do that. In that case, what we do is we do either US agent, which can be another business or it can be a US citizen. That's what we're talking about today is how to use a US citizen as your petitioner, is it appropriate? Is it appropriate? Absolutely so. Yes, it's fine. Typically they'll ask for information that proves that the petitioner is a US citizen, whether that be their birth certificate or a passport, a naturalization document. And one thing to think about is while it is appropriate, there's nothing wrong with a US citizen serving as the petitioner. It could be problematic in certain structures. So if you're doing the structure as the citizen is just a U.S. agent that doesn't have anything to do with the petition and there's a foreign employer that's clear and it's articulated that they're the ones actually doing the work, then that makes sense, especially if the citizen doesn't have any former background in the industry that the visa applicant is pursuing. Now that could be problematic if the visa applicant is a boxer and the citizen employer is saying, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I'm going to be a boxing promoter and directly pay the athlete millions of dollars per bout. That's something that USCIS is going to look unfavorably upon. And there's a lot of other circumstances are less obvious than that, where there might be problems as a U.S. citizen filing the petition. So while it is good, sometimes it is advantageous, especially if there's no background in that industry and making the type of moves or circumstances that the visa applicant will be doing. in and so that way sometimes it's better off to just use a petitioner service that does have a reputation for doing things in that industry that will make much better sense for that and I'd like to share one that we like was this innovative um global talent agency and we like this because they are very experienced in serving as a petitioner. They have robust former clientele, and they actively try to find gigs and opportunities for the visa applicants. So if they do not have a petitioner, rather than using a citizen that might not have the background to carry the weight of the petition, they can always use a petitioner service such as this one. that might even find opportunities for them to do. For example, if you're a boxer, they could find you boxing bouts or introduce you to promoters. If you're a book writer, they can introduce you to publicists. If you're an actor, they can introduce you to other agencies or maybe even get you interviews and auditions themselves. So there's a lot of opportunity out there. So while it is appropriate to file an O-1 or P-1 visa with a citizen, just a regular person as a petitioner, It can sometimes prove problematic when it gets to the adjudication of the petition. Just something to think about. I hope that this was beneficial to somebody, even though it's a nuance, but sometimes those nuances are very important. Have a great day.",,,,,

This is Sherrod Seward. I'm one of the lead intake attorneys and directors at Innovative Immigration Law and Shared Sports Visas. And today I'm talking about more of a theoretical and philosophical way of thinking about creating a one visa petitions. We do a lot of visa assistance for other attorneys and participate a lot in groups where there might be other attorneys asking questions about the ones and EB1As and P1s. And we're glad to help. But there's there's one thing that I kind of want to talk about and address publicly and just put it out there for anyone to see, because I think that it's helpful to the industry and also helpful to getting more approvals for all the great folks out there trying to get a one extraordinary ability visas. And that is sometimes we'll do a consulting work for an attorney that doesn't do a lot of O-1 visas and it might be something to where they do a lot of family-based immigration or even a better example is removal defense where you end up in court a lot over these and it ends up being a lot of cases and holdings and legalese arguments that get put into their briefs because that's what they're used to using. But a lot of times in these situations, the things that you're arguing for are more straightforward and not as subjective as the one visa category. If you don't know, like we know most, this is probably more appropriate for people that are already drafting or looking forward to do. immigration law, you know that there's about six or maybe seven, depending on which category you're doing, 01A versus 01B, of criteria that there are, of which you have to prove three. These criteria are usually pretty subjective. And then even when they're not, they are still adjudicated objectively by USCIS. And the long story short is The legal holdings and things like that just really don't hold water if USCIS doesn't want them to. So there can be a lot of effort spent trying to find and cite case laws for these eligibility criteria when USCIS flat out doesn't care. And it really doesn't like apply as much, you know? There are some circumstances like when it does, because one, there's just not a lot of litigation out there when it comes to one visa denials. Anyway, we've done some and we've seen firsthand how just the subject subjective nature of the eligibility criterion just makes it difficult. problematic to pinpoint down on like, you need to do this because of this holding over here, things of that nature. I mean, one case out there that is beneficial is if you're arguing for comparable evidence categories, and then you use the example where they had the national team coach whose pupil won a gold medal, then that can be helpful. But then even if they want to find subjective ways to differentiate that from your particular situation, they'll do that. That's why I think philosophically and on just the results, it's better to leave a lot of the legalese out and just make tangible, make sense arguments about the subjective categories. Supply it with context upon context upon context rather than try to hammer it down in case law because The time spent explaining why an original contribution is important just through finding research or getting some expert opinion letters is well, much more better spent than finding a case law about something that may be kind of the same, but maybe not just because the category, the eligibility categories are subjective. right so they can it makes it easier for them to say no and differentiate uh from one circumstance that's much you know a little bit different from another one even though they might be kind of similar in concept so that's why I always advocate for just bolstering your petition with common sense arguments and common sense um um, supportive documents. So that way, if you do get to the point to where you are presenting a case in court, your record shows a lot of just common sense, copious amount of good information to show why this subjective category should have been, um, should have been approved. And even a lot of times we don't even like to adjudicate the cases where they find, um, that eligibility requirements are not met as opposed to if there's a structural contract issue or something like that, or if it's something obvious like the coach was a national team coach of a bronze medalist and it's well documented that he was instrumental to that success. But that's my two cents on the matter. Case law arguments in O-1 visa petitions are not all that helpful. It's better to do common sense context arguments with outside information just to make it clear as day to an adjudicator that might not want to get into the nitty gritty of finding different holdings and stuff like that. And rather to just say, like, this criteria is not met and see what happens. Hope that's helpful. Hope you find some value in that. And I'll talk to you soon.",,,,,

And if this continues, it's just going to be kind of difficult for unsigned athletes to get opportunities to stay in the United States on work visas, which are either P or O and play. But I have an idea. where the UFL or other minor league football teams that have robust broadcast agreements can come in and have a bigger talent pool without having to invest money in the situation. Now, imagine this. Imagine the agent for the player does the same thing as they would do with the NFL itinerary, but instead they use the UFL itinerary. So they're saying, we have interests from the UFL that we might be able to play this season with any team in the league. It could even come from the league office saying, like MOU, like, yes, we determine that this is an internationally recognized talent, and we anticipate that teams in our league will want to pick them up throughout that and it can be something as similar as a simple as an email. But the players being able to use the UFL itinerary one would allow them to go get their own visas without having to bother the team for much other than like just a letter of interest. And then second, they would be available to play for whatever team depend if it came from the league level, they can play for any team. other than that they can play for you know several teams whoever expressed interest in them now they don't actually have to be placed there but that helps them to get the visa in place so if an opportunity does come up they can take advantage of it meanwhile the team would not have to invest anything in that visa petition other than a letter or email of interest there would be no money they would have to pay as the player can work with their agent or another third party to get the visa place. But it makes them available as a talent pool to the entire league, which I think is something that can be a mutual beneficial thing for anybody and everybody involved with the organization. So I just wanted to introduce this concept through video because I know it's kind of boggy to get through. Sorry that it's six minutes. And I hope that you find some value in this and we can continue the conversation with decision makers. Thank you very much.",,,,,
"May.23,2024",Sherrod Seward discusses Visa Issues for NFL Free Agents,Immigration Sports,Sherrod Seward discusses Visa Issues for NFL Free Agents,Sherrod Seward discusses Visa Issues for NFL Free Agents.mp4,Sherrod Seward discusses Visa Issues for NFL Free Agents.mp3,"How's it going? My name is Attorney Sherrod Seward, and I'm part of the intake lead team at Sherrod Sports Visas and Innovative Immigration Law, where we do a lot of cool things with P&O visas and all types of sports. And today we're talking about probably my favorite sport right now, which is football, American football, which there are more and more international athletes participating in. nowadays. And I kind of wanted to shed some light on some of the issues that are surrounding international foreign football players trying to get into the NFL and some that are already there. We have done visas for current NFL players, prospective NFL players, and NFL players after they are done with their career. And we've had a lot of success. The thing is that there's some The NFL doesn't do a lot of creative things, teams do. It's at the team level. They do not do a lot of creative things when it comes to the structure of petitions, which creates a major obvious problem, is that typically teams will always want to apply for a P1 visa as a team for the players on their roster. The problem is a lot of the foreign players do not actually make rosters and they get cut. When that happens, they have 30 days to switch to a new visa category or leave the country. And a lot of times, unfortunately, they have to leave the country. And another thing is if it's during the middle of the season, it's unlikely that a team would want to pick up a player contract on someone that can't play for two weeks while they wait for their visa to get adjudicated. For that reason, for about three to four years now, we've been advocating and been successful with applying for visas for athletes, football players through their agencies or third parties. So that way the visa stays intact, whether or not the player is on a active roster and the player can use the same visa to play on different teams. We've done that twice. One situation is where we had a kicker that was good at the NCAA level, and we got him an O1A visa, and he was able to play for three different teams on that A1 visa before eventually transferring to getting an EB1A green card. Now, another situation we had was with a player that was cut from one team, and we were able to place a visa for him within a couple of days for him to be available for the practice squad of another team without holding a roster spot. The problem comes in when it comes to the consultation letter and the contracts with the team. The way that we structure the petitions is that there's an agent or a third party that's direct in navigating or even the party themselves navigating where they will play. In addition, we say that there's no consultation letter available, which is something that is usually required in sports to have a labor union, such as the MLS NBA. They want to get a letter from the players association that says that it's okay for this player to participate. The problem is the players association in an NFL will not do that for players that are not currently under a roster. So our stance is we do not need them to give a consultation letter that we can give them to do two things. One to just say that we do not offer letters for players that are not under contract or to just give a letter of no objection, which just says we don't have any problem with the player getting a P1 visa. The problem comes in is when the NFL team or players association might not get the concept and they say, yes, we want a consultation letter that's petitioned for by this entity or the team. Then that's going to create problems that are much worse than if they just said nothing and just let us make our requests and ignore this. It's much worse. The other thing that comes in with USCIS having bogus adjudications is they look at the contract of the player and say like, well, it looks like they're saying they have to play for this team, which counteracts their decision of just choosing where they play, which of course is, I don't know, just pretty asinine because obviously the player gets to choose which team that he's getting ready to play for. A player can then opt to not play for that team or sit out a year. There's a lot of ways to say how they will navigate where they go. But the USS decision on one of our cases was pretty much like, no, it's the team that navigates and directs where they will play, not the player that ultimately decides what team they will play on. So for that reason, we are most often advocating that players get an O-1 visa just because there's a lot more leeway to play with the schedule and itinerary of what you will be doing rather than a P-1, because if you are on a P-1 then you will be required to show that you have competitions in mind that will require the participation of internationally recognized athletes. Second is you're more privy and prone to being boxed in by the NFL Players Association if we get into an issue about the consultation letter. That's only happened once where it's been a problem. Most of the time we're able to get around it, but it did come up once and it's got our attention. The next thing is, When you're an O visa, you're in a category that's much better than the P1 because you can do other things just rather than just compete. The problem comes in sometimes if you come to teams that are unfamiliar with exotic structures for doing the visa, they'll push back and want to change the visa from an O1 to a P1, which is one, a much less prestigious visa to be on with more restrictions. And then second is if they cut that player Now we have to extra work to do to put them back in that other status. So if they just let the 01 rock, there would be no problem with signing them on that O visa and going about this business. And if something happens where the relationships cut short, then there would be no problem. Just letting the player go and he still has his visa intact to do other things. But if they go and file a P1 that changes the status from 01 to P1 or changes his own P1 to the team's P1, when that's reduced, now the player has to either leave the country to come back. on his previous approval or we have to file another petition to reinstate that previous status so it's one of those things that could be avoided with more education and talking to the teams about transparency and how this works which is something that we'll continue to do to give more opportunities to four foreign national football players to enjoy the same opportunities and speed and access to teams as foreign-born players And I think we could all say that we're enjoying the diversity that's in football, getting a lot of different flavors, a lot of different type of athletes. And the teams are appreciating those extra set of skill sets that they're getting as well to compete for the Super Bowl. And with that being said, I hope to continue doing updates on the work we're doing in football and talk to you soon. Peace.",,,,,

My name is Sherrod Seward. I'm one of the lead intake attorneys at Sherrod Sports Visas and also Innovative Immigration Law, where we do P&O and EB1A visas for a lot of the best athletes and entertainers from around the world. Around this time where we get graduation is where we get a lot of inquiries from student athletes looking to see their options for switching over to work visas or seeing what's available to them under the optional practical training program, otherwise known as OPT, and also their F1 visa, which is the standard visa that you get as you matriculate through USA universities and even sometimes at the high school level as a foreign national. In this particular circumstance, we're responding to the common inquiry from tennis athletes. There's a lot of international tennis athletes that come to the United States to compete at the NCAA level and then later want to use that to transition to playing for a club team to either play professional and professional tennis or to work at a club where they can teach tennis or do both. And they want to know what is the best option for them. And the further nuance that we're going to take in this one is an inquiry we got with somebody that's still in school and has also signed up for a name, image and likeness deal, which means they're going to get paid to promote a brand or to just be a part of the team. by a third party so right away there that's going to make um the optical practical training not the best ideal situation because it's going to be unlikely that the major that the athlete is in is in athletics for example if you play tennis on the tennis team but you major in mathematics The OPT needs to be tied to the course of study, not the athletics that you play. So the OPT would be inappropriate. So the next thing you look at is P or O visa, which can be kind of tricky dealing with tennis athletes. Let's look at the P visa. p visa is technically easier to be eligible for as a individual if you're already playing in ncaa level tennis because previous experience in an ncaa level club is one of the seven criteria that you need two of to go and be a good candidate for the p1 the problem comes in on itinerary Each P1 visa petition requires events that need international athletes to compete in them. So for example, this is easy if you're looking at cricket. If you're doing just a domestic town to town cricket league, that's not going to support P1 visas. But if you're doing major league cricket where everybody has a lot of money, there's a lot of international players on each team, then that makes sense for needing a P visa. why this is kind of difficult in tennis is because when people are coming out they're not already on the major tours so if you go and submit a p1 visa without having an invitation from some of the tournaments that the major players play in uscis could deny it saying that we don't think that you're going to participate in competitions that need internationally recognized athletes now what's different about the o1 is this is why I think this is the best category best case scenario for tennis players that are in the collegiate ranks to use is because you do not need big tournaments to bolster your petition also it's perfectly fine to say that you're going to be just coaching tennis and not competing at all or doing both moreover if you have nil deals this is most appropriate visa category for you to be able to take that without any worry at all because we can make the o1 work authorization pretty broad it doesn't have to be just tailored to competition and the sponsors that come from competition it can be if you're coaching a club it can be if you're making your own content it could be on making different type of businesses there's a lot that we can do with the o1 visa category so that's why the preferred visa type for student athletes that are tennis players that are doing more than competing in internationally ranked tournaments. is to definitely go for the O-1 visa that would cover NIL. It would cover working as a coach at clubs. It would cover competing in smaller tournaments and pretty much any other thing that you can think of that's related to tennis. So I hope this helps everybody out there, the student athletes that are swinging those rackets. We're here to help if you need us. We're not hard to find. Thank you very much.",,,,,

This is attorney Sherrod Seward, part of the innovative immigration law intake team. And today we're talking about FOIA requests, which are used a lot in immigration, but could also be used across the board when dealing with federal agencies and trying to get information that might be hard to get in A lot of times now we are filing FOIA requests when we get requests for evidence, denials, or other adverse decisions where there are pretty clearly some issues wrong with the analysis that went in the response. The reason why this is important to everybody is because at the end of the day, these notifications are people that have pulses that have biases that can hold grudges that might be having a bad day and things of that nature. So with that being said, it's absolutely important to keep them honest. They can see the names of petitioners, beneficiaries, and attorneys of record when they perform their adjudications. And there's definitely gonna be times where they might have some feelings some type of way, honestly, about seeing the same person that they might've had a bad experience with or whatever reasons that's out there. People are people, people make mistakes. But when it comes to adjudication of immigration petitions where people put forth resources, sometimes filing fees of upwards of $4,000, they deserve a fair shot at getting a good adjudication. So with that being said, when we get denials, we like to ask for the adjudication number of the officer, which is one, something that used to be automatically on these petitions, and then two, something that we were encouraged to reach out to to try to figure out. And one case that we are looking at potentially litigating just on transparency is we've been having issues consistently with one of the clients that we work with and with a petitioner service that we use. And we just asked for the adjudication numbers, among other things. And we got some interesting responses that are common that the government will use to try to dissuade you from pursuing transparency. So let's just go ahead and add it. So here you can see that it has a shared suit on here, office address. Now, one thing is we are clearly asking for communications about a petitioner and two petitioners. But here at the end, it says, you are requesting records regarding U.S. born citizen and not generally under purview of USCIS. This is clearly erroneous as they state themselves that we are looking for petitioners, cage warriors, SDS sports agency and seeking decisions about that. This didn't have anything to do with a U.S. citizen besides there's a U.S. citizen that owns the entity. And the request is about USCIS decision making about visa petitions for third party individuals. Right. So this is the kind of things that you can look forward to seeing when you're trying to get transparency. And the other part that they'll use is they'll say the adjudication number is in the exception of the B6, which permits the government to withhold information about personnel such as driver's license, Social Security numbers, home addresses, date of birth and other stuff. belonging to a third party considered to be personal. Now we ask for the adjudication number that's used with their official capacity. How on earth did that coincide with a B6 exception that has to deal with personal things? So now it's like, is there communications that they do regarding petitions that they're doing on the government salary, personal items? We didn't ask for any of this information besides. who's the adjudication number. We didn't ask for their names or anything like that. And we asked for internal communications that were related to the case. That being said, you gotta know when doing these FOIA requests that it's not going to be a cakewalk sometimes when it comes to trying to get adverse information to the government. So you gotta be not discouraged by getting responses like that and know that at the end of the day If they give a final action or if there's 20 days where you don't get a response of adequate information, you do have the avenue to sue in federal court to try to get that information. And that's what we intend to do a lot, not only for us, but the entire industry of immigration lawyers and also other individuals and companies and attorneys that deal with government agencies that withhold public information. so that being said I hope that things are going better for you and if they're not we are here to help so thank you very much and I hope you found value in this",,x,,,

And what the idea is, is that there are a lot of people around the world, especially in countries where it's hard to get a visitor visa to come to the United States or job opportunities that are taking great lengths to come to the United States, whether it be by coming through the border on the southern border or the Canadian border, or by significant investment into the United States using the EB-5 category. If you're unfamiliar with the EB-5 category, that is the investment vehicle that you can use to obtain permanent residence in the United States. It usually features at least a million and a half, well, about $1.2 million of investment. And then there's a lot of fees that come on top of that, including dealing with your professional service providers, business plans, and then even after you obtain the EB-5, you're still required to keep at least 10 American jobs going in order to keep the visa without conditions. What we're doing is we're introducing two things. One is we're introducing the concept of using talent based migration to come to the United States sooner and with less investment than the EB-5 and certainly more safer than going through the border to come here. And the second part that we're introducing is we're doing this on kind of a contingency program, which means that once you pay the legal fees, if we are unsuccessful in getting the talent based visa for you, then there is a program, there's a plan to resend the fees. Like we'll give the fees back based on a certain type of schedule if you want to continue going or if you want to kind of close your losses and then go the other way. So I'm going to introduce my screen now so we can see kind of what we're talking about. So innovative migration services is specific for our people that are looking to obtain personal permanent residence. at different places around the world. But of course, we specialize in the United States. So the idea is we charge a set fee to which we try various avenues to get you to permanent residence. Because a lot of times what will happen is you'll have a consultation with an immigration lawyer and they'll try to figure out one pathway that works for you when there really might be three pathways that are worth trying. And depending on the officer that you get, it gives you a better chance. Because a lot of times clients with the resources just want results. And it saves a lot of time, sometimes years, just trying all those things at one time is which we specialize in. So if somebody comes to us and they're looking at migrating to the United States quickly, what we do is we file a couple of applications. We'll file immigrant applications and also non-immigrant applications. non-immigrant petitions. And the reason we do both is because the immigrant petitions take a long time to get physical access to the United States, while the non-immigrant visas get you access much quicker, especially using the visa category that we do, which is the O-1 visa. So I'm going to go into there now. So the O-1 visa is a talent-based visa for any industry where a person has risen to the top of their field. And we are very good and proficient at making these arguments because it's kind of the only visa category we do besides P1 for athletes in the non-immigrant category. So that's why we are very confident in using this program under the 01A or 01B, depending on how... the background of the candidate looks for this to get great results. With the 01A and 01B, you can obtain approval using premium processing in 15 days or less if everything goes fine. And then oftentimes there is very short wait times for 01 visas in countries where there usually is a long list, a long time to wait. And it's something that we can actually look at. Let's see if this still works. And even in places where the wait time for O-1 visas is a little bit longer than we like, we're usually very good at getting an expedited appointment. So if we're looking at this, they don't even have it listed for interview required things for O-1P visas. Wonder why it's not listed at all. Let's try, what's another city? All right, so see here. If you get an interview waiver, you can get that within a single day in Shanghai. And even for these, when they say 73 calendar days, we can get those expedited using our methods for the consular, consular issues and moving those up. Just curious. See if this one's better. All right, so it's still not listed for those. So that's something we have to look into. But we haven't had any problems going into the portal and getting interviews within the month, especially with our relationships that we have with our congressional people. All right, and then so we'll file O-1 visas, even visitor visas. We'll file whatever category of non-immigrant visa makes sense to get you physically into the United States as fast as possible. After that, or actually at the same time, we will also file for your talent based immigrant visas. And this case, there's two that we work with. The one is the EB-1 Extraordinary Ability. That's similar to the 01A as far as arguments, but it comes with the ability to change over to permanent residence. So the idea is you file for that and your 01. You get approved for the O-1 visa, come to the United States, and then from there, once your EB-1A is approved or you can add premium processing to get it approved quicker, that will allow you to do adjustment of status to where you can stay in the United States while you apply for your green card, wait for advanced parole. and then you can go. What about my family members? That's a great question. So the O-1 visa, you can get O-2s and O-3 visas for family members, sometimes even O-2s for extended family members that are not immediately parties for you. So uncles and aunts and things like that, that you might work with in your business or your talent, or that you can make the argument that you do, then you can apply for them for O-2 visas, O-3 visas for immediate family members and get everybody in to the country. And then to start working on your adjustment. And like I said, we try. Oh, the other part that we would do on a talent base is if it makes sense is to try an EB2 national interest waiver. This is a version of the EB2 where you do not need a job in the United States to make these arguments. It basically says that you have a skill set that is wanted by the United States, and therefore you should be permitted to stay even without having a job offer. And there's certain industries that get pushed for this. Like right now, data science, artificial intelligence and computer science are huge points of emphasis with the Biden administration that they will look favorably upon EB two national interest waivers in this category. But Since we're trying the O1s, we're trying the EB1s, we're trying the EB2s, there's just such a high likelihood that there's going to be success, especially with how hard that we're working. And then in the case that none of it works, that's when you start looking at the schedule to see if you either want to continue or if you want to rescind fees. But the nitty gritty of how that is available to us, once you do a consultation, we do executive consultations that are paid just to make sure that the people that we're doing business with are serious because we're serious attorneys and we are putting a lot of effort into all of these visa petitions that we're doing. So it's like we have a set fee. We try all the options that we can to get it together. The client is responsible for filing fees for the various avenues that we take. And in the event, unlikely event that nothing works, there is a schedule that where you can either recover fees or keep your fight going to have a great life in the United States. And that being said, I appreciate your time today to listen to this new, exciting initiative that we're pushing to the market. And we hope to work with you, your family, your clients soon. Thank you very much. And we look forward to hearing from you.",,,,,
"May.22,2024",Introduction for recruiters  of AI Talent,Tech Studio ,Introduction for recruiters  of AI Talent,Introduction for recruiters  of AI Talent.mp4,Introduction for recruiters  of AI Talent.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward and I'm a partner at Innovative Immigration Law as well as a principal at Innovative Global Talent Agency. And I'm contacting you because we are interested in you and you are interested in us as serving as one of our recruiters in the important field of artificial intelligence, computer science and data engineering. What we're reaching out to you with is an opportunity to work with us to find some of the best minds in your region that deal in these categories of industries, which are persons that are at least at the master's level of artificial intelligence, computer science, in data mining, which I'd say data science as well. And what we are looking to do with these individuals is work with them to obtain a special visa, which is called an O-one related visa or an EB-two permanent interest waiver for permanent residents to come to the United States and work with our partners. What we do is we use our immigration law firm to obtain these visas and we use our talent agencies to place these individuals with some of the best companies in the United States. How it works is while we are waiting on the visas to be drafted, In order to have the proper profile, it's good if the candidates have good projects that they're working on and have completed that we can use to show in their visa application that they are indeed a world class data scientist, computer scientist or artificial intelligence professional. So while we are doing the visa process, is it expected that the applicants would be working on selected projects by us? to help them with their visa profiles in order to be successful obtaining those O-one visas. One of the things that's great about O-one visas is that it's dual intent. We know that in a lot of countries, people are stopped for visitor visas and work visas and denied at the consulate. This is not likely to happen with the O-one A. Even if you come to the consulate and say that I permanently plan to stay in the United States, if you're interviewing for O-one visa, you will not be denied for that reason as it is dual intent. I'm going to now share my screen to show some more details. So the reason why this is so important to us is that the Biden administration has put together a presidential advisory committee on bringing the best artificial intelligence persons to the United States. And these are the visa categories that best serve that purpose. And so what we're looking for is our recruiters to go and find candidates that fit the mold of our intake sheet. So it's somebody that has good experience making their own projects, maybe on good help working with world class organizations in your country, achieving hopefully the doctorate level of education, if not at least masters. And what would happen is you would need to get these candidates to fill out this get started with us. which is right here. And when they fill this out, what will happen is our attorneys will vet them to see if they're good candidates to participate in the process. If we decide that they are a good candidate to fit in the process, we will ask them to sign up various one of our mechanisms, which range from a free scholarship to a a scholarship until an application fee. One thing that does happen is that there's not a legal fee charged for this as the talent agency works with the immigration law firm to get this done. But in certain cases, there is administration fee to help with the cost of putting this together and to make sure that our candidates are serious about this endeavor. But from time to time, we do give scholarships to where the candidate would not have to pay an application fee to deal with the talent agency. And I mentioned that there are projects that we have the talent work on while they're going. And so the projects are listed here, and there is a tech person that navigates and tells the details of each project to keep them going so that way nobody is idle but we are very excited about your interest in working with us the compensation is once somebody completes the intake form and they sign up to be a candidate with the talent agency you have earned a hundred dollars uh commission so you can do as many of those as you want there's no limit as long as they are accepted into the program and pay their application fee if it's applicable then there will be a commission paid for finding these wonderful minds for us to participate in our program so I hope this explains everything in great detail and we look forward to you maybe working with us and helping us find the best data scientists artificial intelligence modelers and data scientists in the world, computer scientists in the world. Thank you very much for your attention and we look forward to potentially working with you.",,,,,

I hope that was very clear, straightforward, and you understand now what the mission is, and we can go forward and be great. As you know, this is a commission-driven bonus, a driven opportunity. You get your stipend, but also we believe in rewarding. good work and great results so going forward you'll get well you probably already have the videos you have some text explanation of everything and then we'll also include the links that we went into during this course we will set up a portal for feedback that you can always email to ask questions and there will be follow-up videos and support sessions weekly or biweekly to make sure that everybody's on the same page and we're getting the type of results that we like on this initial project, which is to pitch the petitioner service. So thank you so much for doing this. We're really looking forward to you getting involved and let's get it.",,,,,
"May.21,2024",Module 6_ Ethics and Legal Compliance,Business Development or Marketing,Module 6_ Ethics and Legal Compliance,Module 6_ Ethics and Legal Compliance.mp4,Module 6_ Ethics and Legal Compliance.mp3,"Hey, how's it going? I'm back and I'm probably with the one module where I don't share my screen at all talking about the ethical and compliance considerations with this. Fortunately, there's not a lot to talk about here. It's pretty straightforward. The one thing to understand is, especially as pitching direct to attorneys is that we're not selling legal services we're only selling the petitioner service so we're not saying hey we're here to provide p and o1 legal support to your clients what we're doing is just offering a petitioner service which is very important we're not giving legal advice we're We're just offering the petitioner service, telling about the details, how much it costs and how we will actively find opportunities for the clients that we choose to work with on this. Remember that the pricing is $2,000. or 3000, depending on situation, to start the process. And then from there, it's a commission-based thing based on the opportunities we bring in for that talent. And also there's nothing precluding the talent from getting their own activities. If they already have them, they can surely do that. It's just two better opportunities get more consistent results with the service. That's why we actively seek opportunities for them. So we can say we're navigating and directing where they will compete. But we definitely have a contract that says they are free to get their own activities here in the United States that line up with their cause. So if they're a boxer, they can find their own fights. If they are a painter, they can definitely do their own commission gigs. It's just that they have to do stuff that's in line with what their purpose of their industry is in. They can't say that they're going to box and then go and drive trucks around, for example. That's not going to work. But the main thing, the main point to know is that we're not selling legal services. We are just presenting the petitioner service and providing the documents needed for a legal professional to be able to take it from there. Thank you very much.",,,,,

Welcome to the next module where we're going to talk about the tools that we'll have available for you to help do your job. Of course, we won't just leave you hanging. We'll try to give you as much support as we can on the creative side and on the tool side when it comes to web-based applications to get this going. Let me share my screen and show what we have here. For one is we definitely have the website that you can always point people to. And we've already showed you my press kit, which is very easy to get to. It's just www.oaklg.com backslash press kit. Okay. Now you'll also receive your own email portal for you to reach out to people. And then you'll also get access to a Google voice, a Google voice account that you can use to, to contact people. Now here, what we're going to do is we're going to make a tab that's just going to be for innovative immigration law. What it'll be is kind of similar to this. It'll have like common correspondences where you can go and see frequently asked questions, copy and paste stuff. You'll get a list of the contacts that we have. So you can always go and pull up the spreadsheet, see the last contact, the last notes that were there, and then reports on intake, right? And then, so say if you, you also get an email address like this. So right now it will be in my email, but like pretend it's your email. actually let's use this one so pretend it's your email whenever you contact somebody you can go you can go leads at ompvisas.com and then type your message this will make sure that your conversation gets recorded in our back end so we can keep track of what type of conversations went out already okay Next, we have custom links that make it easy to send out the sales tools. So invoices are always going to be 2,000 or 3,000. So if you put that in, innovativeglobaltalent.com backslash 2,000, then the service fee will come up. The same for 3,000 should be there too. Oops. So 3,000. And the other thing that will come up is on contracts. There'll be different type of contracts we have to do with the talent. So for example, if it's a boxer, we'll get you a list of all these that are go that are, that are active links to help us out. This is the combat sports agreement. So this is the contract that the talent would need to sign. Oh, it's like that one's not up. We got to fix that one. It's like it was working and then it stopped. Oh, there it is. So you see how this one brings a contract up that they can easily sign. But this is an easy tool that we always look for feedback to see how we can be even more efficient with it. But again, we'll give you a A email address will give you a Google Voice account to contact people. We're working on trying to get a WhatsApp account, but we don't have that done yet. You'll get access to the portal where you can get the templates, the easy link to the customer lists, an email box that you can send your questions and leads to. So we can be all on the same page and then a list of URL links to make easy things for collecting payment and also for collecting the contracts that we need for the fighters and other talent that we're doing business with. All right. Sounds good. And I'll see you in the next module.",,,,,

We're getting a little bit more into the business development piece in module four, where we're talking about how to get around gatekeepers. Honestly, and I think you can anticipate that there might be some pushback in terms of getting in front of the attorney. A lot of the times are maybe not a lot, hopefully, but it will come up to or it might be hard to get in front of the person that's a decision maker. Typically, you do not want to be speaking with paralegals about this service. You want to be talking to either office managers or hopefully the attorneys themselves that actually write the petitions because they're the ones to most likely understand the power of the tool and service that we're offering. One major way to get in the door with that is. is to kind of lead with the reputation of the firm already. I'm going to share our screen to kind of share who we are. So this is Shared Sports Visa's website. And we've already done hundreds of visas for some of the most important athletes in the world including um canelo alvarez tyson fury this is one of the best archers in the world this is a ufc former champion so we have a lot of accolades behind us so a lot of times you can say hey we're contacting you from the former attorneys of shared sports visas where we're known for um you know our excellence with world champion boxing cricket stuff like that and you could also use my press kit which is right here. I have no problem with you saying like, here's a press kit of the managing member of the firm. He wanted me to reach out to you. And you can say, he's really getting out of practicing law. He really wants to just support other attorneys with the petitioner service and switch over to being a talent agent, which should be very effective. So, If you are getting pushback on your own trying to get through, you can say, hey, no, I'm reaching out to you on behalf of Sherrod. Here's what he's done. Check out his website, see his press kit so that they can see the reputation that's with the firm and become more comfortable. And from there, you should be able to better get somebody on the other line or on email that is an actual decision making with this process. but this uh a national an actual decision maker for the petitioner service and also they won't get them the first time so you got to be organized and adamant about contacting everybody maybe once every two weeks nothing too salesy but just to keep the contact in the conversation going uh with these persons look forward to the next module",,,,,
"May.21,2024",Module 3_ Business Development for Petitioner Service,Business Development or Marketing,Module 3_ Business Development for Petitioner Service,Module 3_ Business Development for Petitioner Service.mp4,Module 3_ Business Development for Petitioner Service.mp3,"Welcome to module three, which is one of the most important. That is business development. How are we going to actually get the business and what is expected of you when it comes to seeking this business? For one, it will not be contacts that you have to find yourself. That's not the expectation as of now, is that we definitely have a list of potential customers for this that are primarily other immigration attorneys that we understand to practice an O&P visas. and also maybe attorneys that we've worked with in the past. Occasionally they'll be direct to talent, which means there's no attorney involved and we're just working with a talent themselves to do the petitioner service. But typically the contacts will already be made in a list. Now, as far as the cost of it is typically the petitioner service will have a flat fee at first of two to $3,000. And then from there, the only compensation we would get is when we place an opportunity for the talent. So if the person getting the visa gets a book deal, or if they get a movie, or if they get a fight or competition and get paid through that by something we set up, then the talent agency will receive a portion of those fees, which is usually 20% of what we arranged for the client. so again typically we will provide a list of contacts that are almost always other immigration attorneys the cost of the petitioner service is two to three thousand dollars initial fee and then we collect money as um commission when we set items and itineraries and gigs for the person uh to do so to get started what we will do is I'll share my uh screen again is like you'll get a list like this, And I'll have the emails and also the phone numbers for the attorney. This one doesn't happen to have the phone numbers, but we can get that. And what we would expect is we'd have some scripts that you can use to tailor messages to these persons. And then also we'll give ideas of what to say over the phone to get them interested. So you don't have to make up things necessarily by yourself, but you would get the support of us giving you templates. And then also I'll be doing probably weekly or biweekly trainings to where you can send the firm or myself frequently asked questions of what they're having for feedback. And so that you can have that support and consistently add to your Rolodex of how to respond to different questions that you see all the time. All right. And so if you're emailing them, you'll have your own email account to where you can do that from innovative global talent email. And then when we're sending invoices, it's actually pretty simple. It's an innovative global talent and it might be 2000 for that. Net easily brings up the invoice. And then when they're ready, To go and collect the documents you would just send them an email that would ask them for certain information we need from the form usually be this. candidate and that would bring it up. bring up a form for them to fill out so that we would have the information we need about the candidate to go ahead and get started. But the business development part will be very easy. We'll give you the contact list. We will also provide you with templates for both written and spoken materials. And we'll also try to do a weekly or every other week training session where we can go over frequently asked questions. And we'll also make a box to where you can send emailed questions in that we can answer you as you go forward. But the business development is going to be pretty smooth sailing. You'll have plenty of support and we'll be sure to be kind of responsive as you get the same type of questions over and over. Look forward to the next module.",,,,,
"May.21,2024",Module 2 - Understanding what the petitioner service is,Business Development or Marketing,Module 2 - Understanding what the petitioner service is,Module 2 - Understanding what the petitioner service is.mp4,Module 2 - Understanding what the petitioner service is.mp3,"All right, now we're into module two, where we're gonna get into more nuanced conversation of what the petitioner service is and what it does. So these are the things that it does. And I'm going to share my screen to one of our web pages to what it means. All right, so every PRO petition requires a sponsor. This is the one that will actually sign the immigration forms associated with the petition. And the petitioner or sponsor is responsible for a couple of things. Number one, we agree to receive service of process on behalf of the visa applicant. So that means like if the visa applicant, the person getting a P or O visa is sued, they can sue them civilly at our address. It doesn't mean that we have any civil liability, but we do accept the mail of where they can be sued because if they don't have an address here in the United States, they could be hard to find. So that's why we serve as the address where they can serve the lawsuit. Next, we assert that the contents of the petitioner are true. That means we state that whatever's in that visa petition is correct. And it's not like a lie. So we can't have somebody that says I'm a boxer and then they're gonna come and drive trucks. We're saying that we understand them to be coming to actually do the activity they said they're gonna do. And then the third thing is, is if for some reason The petition, the visa petition is cut short before it's supposed to. For example, if the person has to be deported, then ultimately the petitioner is responsible for reasonable travel, the cost of it, basically of them going home. The United States government's not going to cover the bill of sending someone back home when there's a petitioner involved. All right. So that's what the service is. But when we're dealing with other attorneys and people's applications, what's also important is that we provide the proper documentation and structure for the petition to go through. So one of the things we do is we provide either the information required to fill out the immigration forms or actually fill out those immigration forms for the attorney or the individual. if they're doing it themselves. We also supply some supporting documentation to show that we are in business. We are actively seeking opportunities for individuals and give them background in our tax documents that go with the business as well. And we also give a statement to show that we have under 25 full time employees because there are some fees that are associated with larger employers. Okay. So to reiterate, the petitioner service is the sponsor or the entity that signs off on immigration form. What we do to make it easy to work with is that we agree to receive service of process, we provide a contract, that the attorney or person can use with the petition as it goes out. We also send the supporting documents that are required to get the petition through USCIS with no issues. And we also make a special pact to not circumvent other attorneys. So since we're immigration attorneys ourselves, there might be other immigration attorneys that think we'll take their business. So what we do is we have a contract with them. We agree not to do the immigration work for the client. but rather just serve as the petitioner and support them in that role to help make them comfortable with it. All right. So that's the second module. I look forward to continuing this in the next module.",,x,,,
"May.21,2024",Module 1 - Explaining O and P Visas,Business Development or Marketing,Module 1 - Explaining O and P Visas,Module 1 - Explaining O and P Visas.mp4,Module 1 - Explaining O and P Visas.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward and I'm the managing member here at Innovative Immigration Law and Sherrod Sports Visas. I'm also the principal with Innovative Global Talent Agency. And this is the introduction to my explanation on what it means to serve as a petitioner for a P&O visa. And the reason for this one is this is going to be our internal training to teach our folks how to speak with other attorneys that do what I do, which is apply for visas for individuals around the world in the P&O category and serve as their petitioner. That is the main thing that we're talking about today. So let's begin with what is it that we do? Because if you know my my primary thing I'm known for and the firm is known for is we apply for visas for athletes and entertainers and entrepreneurs whether it be a P visa or O visa and bring them to the United States. But what we're looking to do now is there has to be someone that signs off on those immigration forms to serve as the petitioner. It doesn't mean that they're necessarily the employer of the person, but rather they're the person that signs off on the documents that say that it's okay for this person to come to the United States, why they are such a high commodity as far as their talent, and explains what they will be doing in the United States. What happens a lot of time is someone that might want a P or an O visa, but they're in India, they're in Jamaica, they're in China. They don't know anybody in the United States to serve as their petitioner. That's why we created this service to one, actually serve as the petitioner in circumstances where there's no one else to do it, but also we help find opportunities for these individuals to do. For example, if they're a boxer, we will help find them fights. If they are a writer, an artist, we will help find them publishing deals. If they are a technology person, we will help them find jobs to do IT work, AI work, things of that nature. And what this service that we need from you is to contact other attorneys that are likely to have clients that are in the same boat that need a petitioner to think about letting us do it on their behalf. All right. So I'm going to share my screen and show you a couple of things. So this is our immigration website for athletes. Athletes primarily get P visas. or they get O visas. Anytime they do either one of these, they're going to need a petitioner. Now this is our other brand. Let's see, I did the wrong one. O and P visas dot com. We made this website to let people know that we service more than just athletes. We do entertainers. We do entrepreneurs, things of that nature. And we usually do these for O visas. It's the same thing. If they need if they don't have anybody in the United States that can serve as their petitioner, then we will step in and do that and also help them with finding opportunities for them to work in. And what we do that with is this, Innovative Global Talent Agency. This is the actual service that will sign the immigration forms and then help them find opportunities for them to do in the United States, right? So what this job pretty much is for now, this project is to contact attorneys that deal in business related immigration and then tell them about the talent agency and to sign up to do a consultation with us for that. Right. And kind of where we can find the attorneys is is like this. Sometimes we just already know some that do these type of investor visas. But if we do business and employment and we pick like Charlotte. Take the name out. we do a search and we're doing business and employment because these are a type of attorneys that would do oh ones as you can see here we get quite a bit of people here that come in and we can use them like we'll call them and these are be the potential customers but they're all around the world that might be potential people that are that are potential clients of ours so to reiterate What we do primarily is we are a law firm that files P1 and O1 visas for entertainers and athletes and entrepreneurs, but we're moving towards doing this for other attorneys under our talent agency. And what we need to do is have attorneys that also do P&O visas contacted to introduce this talent agency so we can introduce this service to their clients. All right, I'll see you in the next module.",,x,,,

I'm the principal of innovative immigration law and also innovative global talent agency. I'm making this video because we have a very great need for an executive assistant that has great skills with verbal communication to make calls for us for various initiatives. And I was going to just share my screen now so I can kind of explain who we are and what the opportunity is. So we are based on shared sports visas, which is US immigration for a lot of athletes, including world champions such as Tyson Fury, Canelo Alvarez, and many UFC champions, and a lot of sports around the way. Now, we also have services that do for other professionals in the same category, whether it be important business people, actors, you know, pretty much industry, any industry out there where we can prove that somebody is one of the best in the world at it. Now, what the immediate opportunity is, is we are starting a talent agency to where we procure visas for these persons, but we also find them things to do, like if we were an artist manager or an athlete manager. And that's here. And so with the immediate opportunity we have is we need to have someone that we train very well to call other law firms that do what we kind of do on the side and then tell them about this service. Because what this service does is when people do a P or an O visa, which is what we specialize in, they need someone in the United States to sign off on the paperwork and then also find them opportunities for things to do. and so that's what we do and so right now we're looking to hire somebody to first start calling other immigration attorneys that we have a list of that may service omp visas for other athletes entertainers and let them know about our petitioner service so that they refer clients to us for that purpose this is the first initiative that we have now the next one after this is going is uh See if that works. I might've spelled it wrong. We'll know in a second. Sometimes you have too many websites. Yes, there it is. Innovative Global, this is global migration services. For this one, we're looking to partner with people that have high net worth to help them get access to permanent residence in the United States through talent. So a lot of times these persons will be only privy to doing this through investment by investing a million dollars, sometimes more, but we're able to do that for much cheaper, just using their acumen that they have done in business. and maybe other things as well. That's going to be the second initiative that we're looking for this position to fulfill. The first one is letting other attorneys in the United States know about our petitioner service. The second is reaching out to maybe referral sources or even direct to potentially high net worth individuals about the possibility of obtaining a passport in the United States through their talent as opposed to their investment. i will be traveling to belize later this week and that's when I would like to meet with the most qualified candidates so after hearing this if you think this is uh attractive to you and interested in hearing more about it um reach out to the hr people uh that'll be the one that emails you this video and we'll see with uh we can get you on the schedule why I am personally in town so Thank you very much for your attention to this and hopefully look forward to seeing you soon. Have a great day.",,,,,

We just got in an intake sheet and want to do a review to see what type of visa is most appropriate. I see that you are interested in an EB1A. OK, so I see that there are a lot of accolades in the conference. Great that you got a scholarship. Oh, even a research paper, that's great. So we do a lot of tennis. And so we know kind of like the difference between the pro rankings versus the collegiate rankings. And what I would say is, that you're more at the level of a P1 visa. And typically, you'd want to be well into your pro career or maybe even to your coaching career where you have people that have won national or international tournaments to go. But from going straight with an illustrious college career, as you have, and it's great, I think it would be an uphill battle for doing it as an EB1A, but I think you should go for P1A, have that for a couple of years, build your resume. And then from there, look at doing the EB1A. I know that might not be the news that you wanted, but that is the news we see from doing these all the time. I think you should hold up on the EB1A and do the P1. Hope this is helpful and we look forward to working with you. Thank you very much.",,x,,,

I'm the intake attorney here at Innovative Immigration Law, Sherrod Sports Visas. Right now I'm doing a candidate evaluation for Cadence, pretty name Brace, from Canada. I'm going to add my screen so we can go see what's going on here. Usually in tennis, it's going to be the rankings that matter a lot. So let's look at WTA. All right, so I see that... She has won some prize money, career high of three hundred fifty eight ranked in the world. No titles, but that's fine. Oh, yeah, and you're already welcome to the WTA World Tour, so you are a great candidate for the P one visa. Now we're looking at ITF. It has your junior rankings. See in two thousand want to get as high as two to ninety two. Great win record. I don't see. OK, so let's look at your wiki Wikipedia. Yes, your WTA draw. It's great that you have that. I'm looking to see if you have any accolades listed. Already, you're a great candidate, but it'd just be nice if we knew if you had won any national titles or things like that. before you went in. But yeah, we'll go ahead and confirm you as a great candidate for P-One. Nice ranking, good junior background too. It'd just be great to know if you've won, competed maybe when you're younger with the national team against other national members, not as a single individual player, but on behalf of the Canadian Tennis Federation. And then if you've won any special awards at a national or international level, not necessarily like a tournament win, but maybe you got recognized as special player of the week. Maybe you got invited to a prestigious tournament that everybody doesn't get to go to. But yeah, this is a great candidate for P one and we look to work with you. Great job.",,x,,,

We have an inquiry for Kenroy Williams affiliated with the Orlando Galaxy cricket team, and I'm just going to go and kind of look over the situation. Typically for cricketers, we do P-one or O-one visas, depending on what they're going to do and their background. Now, P-one visas are really only going to work if they are affiliated with major league cricket or one of the official minor league teams of that. So first, let's look that up. shut down quick gloves atlantic conference minor league cricket all right so it's one of the seven semi-professional leagues with minor league cricket of minor league cricket. And it's on the website. So with that being said, this is an opportunity to do the P one based on the affiliation with major league cricket. So the P one of a visa is available for there, which is a little bit cheaper than the, um, Oh one next time we need to look at his background to see what type of accolades that he has over here. The first thing that comes up is, uh, Cricketer, so he was selected to play with the national team. That's great. We can use that. Let's see what Cricket Info says. So he's done T-Squad. And good, so we have his international team here and we can see that he's been playing some pretty good. Pro level. Right there. Interesting to see if he's got any like awards, oh. Does he have a? Olympic profile as well. So that's awesome. But yeah, I'd say this is definitely a great candidate for P-one visa. Plenty of stats online. And so I think that's good to go. So I think he's good for P one because the league is affiliated with major league cricket and he has the national team appearance. So that right there breaks for a pretty straightforward case. I will send you details or have the, the, the team sends you details on pricing and options. Thank you very much.",,,,,

My name is Attorney Sherrod Seward, and I am performing a visa evaluation for you. I see that you're interested in the EB-A visa. And so I went and we like to use the search engine to see what type of things that are out there that could help us determine if it's great for you. So being an actor, of course, we start with IMDB. So you've been doing that for, uh, fourteen years old, Malaysia. Okay. And you've been in a very important series. Okay. I see that you have a very, very healthy following on social media, which of course goes a long way to showing that you are internationally recognized. Beautiful. Now, one thing is, depending on how fast you're trying to get here, you might want to consider the O one a visa. If you a lot of times we'll have people if they're not already in the United States come on an O one a. But I saw that you have an eight one eight number. Let me know that you're probably already in California. In that case, you can apply for the EB-A and also apply for adjustment of status at the same time if you're looking to get your green card sooner than later. So you can either, one, wait for the EB-A to be approved and then file for the adjustment of status, which is where they change you to a green card holder, or you can do both at the same time and you'll get your advanced parole within probably like six to eight months will allow you to travel back and forth while the adjustment is being adjudicated. Or you can wait till the EB-A is approved and then file for the adjustment of status. Accept these. Sutter House. All right, those look like good productions. So congrats on your success. Now, you can always do the O-one-A if the permanent residence is not as important to you as getting the access to United States. But I think that you are already here since you have the eight-one-eight number. And yeah, eleven credits, that's good. That is miserable. yeah so this is where we broke out fifty nine episodes that's great yes I think you're a great candidate for eb-one a but if you want to do the o-one just have access to united states if you need it to stay longer um that's fine too but um yeah proud of that you are able to find us and we look forward to helping you out thank you very much",,x,,,

Let's just make sure that everything is looking good. We got you put up here. Let's see. Someone says twenty one. Have you been active? Okay. Yeah. So you're training with Bo nickel and you're now a pro fighter. So that's, uh, that's great. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. So you have a lot of press with you as well. Just see, just showing your rankings as North America. All right, no worries. Oh, if you have a fight matrix. Let's look at fight. Yeah, since you do have the two pro fights, I think it's great to show that you're active and we confirm that you're a good candidate to renew your P-one visa. So if you do not have a petitioner, we do have a petitioner service that we do business with in MMA. What they will do is they charge a fee to serve as a petitioner, but they also will help you find bouts in case you don't have a manager and things of that nature. And it looks good for the itinerary portion of things. So if you do need to make a change in petitioner, that's no problem. We do have someone that can step in to do that.

I'm the lead intake attorney here. And, uh, we're getting ready to do a evaluation for Mr. Danny Hartwell, MMA fighter. Um, and you're probably looking for a P one visa. So, uh, what I'm going to do is share my screen so you can see the same thing that we're doing. Um, so right here, we already looked you up on topology, a very good record. Great regional rankings. Now this one is probably most helpful to us because this is an international ranking as opposed to these are like national rankings, right? XFC, that's here in the United States, isn't it? That's in Florida. All right. Oh, we saw that you fought in the world championships too. So that's great. So when are you fighting in Oh, we don't have the results for that fight yet. Okay. No problem. What we like to do is look at fight matrix for rankings. Maybe this will rank it up. It's got topology. Oh, XSC was in New Zealand. Okay. Maybe we need to do this too. It used to be really easy to bring up the Fight Matrix rankings. But it's been pretty tough. Here we go. Oh, you're an amateur fighter. Okay. So you're an amateur fighter. Okay. So, uh, MNA is a championship. It might be much better if you had pro. Because that's probably why you're not showing on Fight Matrix. Yeah. I think, unfortunately, you'll probably need more pro fights in order to get a P-Wing. Cause it'd be something if I like, maybe if you won the IMM AF. Okay. So here we have results. Well, here you have MMA team Ireland. Yeah. you were part of a national team I think that counts I think with this like you do have enough yeah I think you do have enough for a p-one now that I see that you are officially competing with uh the national team so yeah I go ahead and I'll sign off on you for a p-one visa we're gonna have to really rely heavily on the national team um on the national team appearance, maybe even showing how you competed to become a part of the national team and then showing that, uh, your highest placement at those, uh, world championships. So let me say it. I think you're a good candidate for P one based on your national team experience, uh, here, but you wouldn't be with what team were you on? All right. So you compete with Ireland. Yeah. So, I mean, that's you here competing for this team. I do think that's a good result for AP one. We just have to really drive that home and maybe get some good interest letters from your other people. All right. Look forward to working with you.",,,,,
"May.21,2024",Sherrod Seward - Tennis Consultation,Business Development or Marketing,Sherrod Seward - Tennis Consultation,Sherrod Seward - Tennis Consultation.mp4,Sherrod Seward - Tennis Consultation.mp3,"Hello, my name is attorney Sherrod Seward and I am sending this video about the tennis player to see what a visa option would be best for them. Ideally, when somebody is working at a club facility and like they're doing a lot of coaching and seminars, things for guests, we like to put them in O-one rather than P-one. But sometimes they just don't have the accolades to get the O-one. So we do it on the P-one and just have it that way. Ideally, we'd like to put it under O-one. So let's go ahead and do our research. So I have her name right here, Ms. Daria. I'm going to search her up and see what we have here. She's on OPT. The big three depart, JSU, James Madison. I actually went to school close to James Madison. I went to there at Hampton. We used to play James Madison in football quite a bit. So we do like that she has some press from her. Let's see if we can find a profile. That's not what I'm looking for. Oh, Sunbelt. Women's tennis player of the week. That's helpful. Be better if it was for the year. Yeah. Because it's still kind of a national award, not like a international award. Let's see if we start looking at rankings and see where she's at. So her career high is seven hundred. And it'd be interesting to know if she's ever played with the national team, that might be something that we can use. So let's look at rankings. See what comes up. Transform. Yeah, these are kind of just stats, main draw. ITA. You know what? I think in this case, it'd be a stretch to do the O one. She must be much better off with the P one. I think that'd be easier to get. in this circumstance just because she doesn't really have the background to support the old one. It's not like she's been working as a coach of other people that have done that. Now, the one thing that could change that is if she happens to have some junior national team experience. So like maybe before she came to college, she did play in some international tournaments as a part of the national tennis federation that she competes in and not get a national championship, but actually compete in an international tournaments as a member of the national team, even if it's youth may be helpful for the O one. But right now I'm definitely going to say that P one is the way to probably go here with her, um, accolades so far and it's a pretty strong P one case too. So we would do that for three years in the first one and on renewal she can look at maybe doing five years. We don't do it five years in the first time just because it does invite a lot of scrutiny um more than more than other things. So I hope this finds you well and we look forward to working with you. Thank you very much. I think I might have forgot to add that to the stage but Yeah, I was over here researching the whole time, but I think you got the gist of what I was looking at. Thank you.",,x,,,
"May.21,2024",Sherrod Seward on EB-1A Visas for poker players,Immigration Sports,Sherrod Seward on EB-1A Visas for poker players,Sherrod Seward on EB-1A Visas for poker players.mp4,Sherrod Seward on EB-1A Visas for poker players.mp3,"Hello, this is attorney Sherrod Seward. I'm responding to an inquiry about an EB-A for a poker individual. So poker, if you have national and international acclaim and also a high placement within World Series of Poker, you're definitely like in the top of that stratosphere when it comes to us being able to prove that someone is one of the best poker players in the world or has been at one time. especially if they are the best that comes from that region. In this particular circumstance, we're aware that you as a beneficiary have won a gold bracelet and one of the first from your country and maybe the only one to do that. That's certainly more than enough to make a great argument for the EB-A visa. So if you're outside the United States and you want to apply for an EB-A visa, there is a couple of ways to go about it. One is you can use regular processing, which will take about eight months to come through. And then when it's approved, we will work to set up an interview for you to obtain that EB-A. In certain countries, that can be a longer wait time than others. But in this kind of realm, of EB-A self-sponsored visas, those wait times are usually much quicker than other type of green card situations. If you're even in more of a hurry and have the resources, you can take advantage of the premium processing for the EB-A portion, which would be business day responses used to be calendar days, but they give responses within. Fifteen business days. And then once approved, that's when we can move to go see if there's a visa available to interview for, to come here on a permanent resident basis. So that's the difference between the EB one and the P or O one is that it is for permanent residents. And so first you apply for the EB one a, if you're outside the United States, and then once approved, that's when you go to the national visa center and we work to get a interview set for that. Now that's the part that's kind of hard to tell how long it takes on that part of it because you never know until you really apply and go see how long the line is there. But say if you are approved for EB-A and the wait time is too long, that you want to do the interview, then you could always come to the United States on an O-one and then apply for the adjustment of status based on your approved EB-one A once you're in the United States. So in this particular circumstance, we found that the beneficiary is very good for an EB-one A candidate being one of the best in our country at the sport of poker. You know, some people call it a sport, some people don't. We think it's a sport. And console processing is just fine. You have great options there that will be presented. Thank you.",,x,,,

I'm responding to an inquiry about MMA visas, specifically for looks like pro and then maybe having amateur fighters on the undercard. So when we're working with promotional partners that we know that we'll do quite a bit of business with, we do have some custom pricing. That custom pricing is per athlete. And then the coaches are a little bit less when it comes to P one S. Um, so when dealing with MMA promotions, it's important to know what the broadcast. Broadcaster is, um, just because if they're doing P one visas, they have to be events that require the participation of internationally recognized athletes. Uh, and MMA, um, that just pretty much means competitions between athletes that are ranked probably in the top four hundred to five hundred in the world. when it comes to fight matrix and we like to use fight matrix because it expresses the rankings internationally not regionally as top topology does so topology will have like rankings in a country and then maybe in the region of like the balkans or something like that but uscis does have a lot of pushback when it comes to um regional rankings we want the international rankings So the pricing is per fighter. And then if you're talking about amateurs or maybe people that don't have a lot of accolades, what we can do is put them either one as a visitor visa, or if they come from the same camps as some of the other fighters, we can put them as essential support staff. And we have the ability to apply for multiple essential support staff on the same visa. Right. So say if we're doing P ones, they usually start at, you know, depending on the situation, anywhere from four thousand to eight thousand. But then essential support staff visas are usually around one to three thousand, depending on the situation in industry and then kind of how much volume and country. and things of that nature. But yes, we can bring in fighters from other countries to compete in MMA events. Those events would need to be pretty robust to support a P-I visa, which is the most appropriate. And for amateur fighters, we can do visitor visas or essential support staff. if they're coming from maybe the same gym or country as some of the other athletes and usually what we do is we'll send over a link with the pricing that we use for corporate size clients for your review that also shows the differences in filing fees and some of the other fees that uscis charges such as premium processing which is optional and now the new asylum fee which depends on how many employees that you have there but I hope that you find this helpful And look forward to working with the MMA fighters. Thank you very much.",,,,,

I figured it might be just easier for me to make this message for you to see how we can work together for one. We have two purposes. We have clients of the law firm that we want to refer out to you. So basically, if they're interested in consular processing, we'll just send them to you. And then there's one fee for that, whether it be for a DS once one sixty and another price for a DS two sixty. For this, we would like to do three hundred for DS. and your pricing is fine. Yes, two sixty. The the arrangement would be that probably we would just refer these clients to you and you charge them these pricing these prices and then that that be it. So they would then be your Clients, we will provide you with the documents that you need to proceed. And anything that we don't have, you can get it from the client. So for DS-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D- You probably will not need to do any interview stuff. If you do, it would be like, you know, like a five-minute thing, but it's not something that we expect you to do a lot of prep for. And that would be, we'd like to do this, like, so we're presenting all the information and maybe no interview. And if it's an interview, just a short one, like a five-minute one, we'd like to have this one at one twenty-five. These are our internal ones that will make sure they have all the documents and almost usually no interview. If there is an interview, there's a short one. Now, I have a way for you to do a lot of business for refusals. We are doing a visa. Let's see. So that's Cricut. All right, so we do visas for the T-TEN, US Masters Cricket League, and we're having problems with O-twos getting approved and O-threes getting approved for this. Now there's a lot of these. If you can show that you can get this through, I can bring you a lot of business for this. And what I say is that, let's look at your price sheet. Cause like we have dozens of these people that are getting stuck on these O twos for refusals in India and in like Pakistan, stuff like that. Actually, let's just go back. All right. So going back again, cause I need to see your pricing. Now this is what I'm asking. If you can do this one as a favor, I can get you more business directly from these people. Let's look at your pricing again. All right. So refusal cases. If you can do five hundred for these, then we got something that includes the DS. the waivers like the two one two D three waivers and stuff like that and make sure they have all they need for the for that response. If you can do one for free, I will get you more cases from from these folks. So just look at this video. Let me know what you think and we can go from there. Actually, let me start writing the email while I'm here. Okay, this is what I want. Here is video. One hundred. And we can do a six hundred. And turn. Uh, one time for DS one sixty or refusals.

I'm one of the intake attorneys here at the law firm, and we are very glad to get your submission for the poker related immigration. And I'm just going to share me going live through your credentials and talking about what's the best way to get you back here in the United States and congrats on all your success. So I'm going to go ahead and add your message here that got back to us and let's go through it. We like that you're with India because this is one of the greatest reasons why to go for the O1 visa and then go for the EB1A and not necessarily P1. It's because we know that a lot of people in India get denied visitor visas and certain type of work visas. The best thing about the O1 is one, we can get you approved for it very quickly. Two is we can get you an interview for this visa very quickly. And this is the most important. The O-1 visa is dual intent, which means that if you go to the consulate and tell them that you're going for an O-1 visa, they can't deny you, even if you say, I never intend to come back. It's because it's perfectly appropriate to say that you're coming and you may think about staying under an immigrant intent from going to the EB-1A. If you're not in a hurry, I mean, if you are like if you want to get into United States beforehand, it's best to go for the 01 because we can get you here very quickly, maybe within the next three to four months. And then after that, you can apply for the EB1A if you do want to stay permanently in the United States. The 01 visa is appropriate. We get them for three years at a time. it's no problem now one thing about the o1 is that it does require a petitioner if you need that there's no problem we do have affiliation with a service that serves as a petitioner any circumstances and can do that for you um to show you right here so that's uh an innovative global talent um this company has a lot of success filing for o1 visas for a lot of great companies and um they'll serve as your petitioner good for three years you don't have to worry about any issues there now let's go back through your credentials and um look at your story so one the first thing we always look at is um oh ones are appropriate if you've had success in your country uh that is very stands out so you've been playing for a long time And you're one of the top players in your country. That's great. We like that you have a lot of coverage about you, which we're going to Google your name in a second. Oh, you've already won a bracelet, the team's event. So even right here, you're a very great candidate for an O one visa. Okay. So you're looking to come here. Having country is good knowledge of American culture and people who fit in. So you've been coming every year for the, um, the tournament, probably on a visitor visa. Okay. So let's look you up. This person we like to look at as a global poker index. This is great. So your rank there, you have a national ranking of 46, and we see that you've won plenty of money compared to everybody else. Yeah, so getting good earnings is one of those things that do push you over the edge when it comes to the O1 and the P1 great rankings. So let's just go to this and just say poker. See what type of stuff come up. So here's your database one. Oh, great, poker listings. New wave of poker pros, that's great. You know, we'd actually like to talk to you about being an agent for some of the other Indian poker players that are coming through. Yeah, this is awesome. You're a great candidate for 01. for that visa and you can do that. Now, since you already have a visa, you would be good candidate for the P1. So you can really go for either one or, you know, the situations where we can go for both just to make sure that one of those gets through. But if you do have the visitor visa, you can come here on that and then we can have the application ready to go for the P1 or the O1. I would suggest going for the O-1. In fact, if we go for the O-1 and for example, something happens bad, we'd really be willing to do the P-1 at a very reduced rate for you, but I don't think you'll have any problems. Now, if you're sure that you wanna do the green card, What we would do is have you come on the 01, and then we would start the EB1A process from there to where you can switch to permanent residence while you're staying here in the United States. And it's something that we can do relatively quickly and have you here. So I hope you found value in this candidate evaluation. I personally grant you a great set of eligibility. for these visa category. Talk about the O-1, but you're good for P-1 too. Just let us know what you want to do. The O-1 is good for three years and the P-1 can be done for five years, but they both can be renewed. And then you can do an EB-1A from either one of those when you're ready. But you just let us know which one you're interested in. We suggest the O-1, but the P-1 is good too. All right. Great candidate. Thank you.",,x,,,

My name is Sherrod Seward. I'm an immigration attorney that primarily focuses on sports and have done numerous kind of solutions for NFL related inquiries. A lot of times what we do is we're getting a visa for somebody that is not on a team or in between teams. And of course, this comes up a lot in a free agency and after the draft. So what I'm contacting about is Ideally, what we would do is file a P1 visa for a player through their agent and explain that together as a team, they'll be directing where they want to play. We were successful with this in the past, but we recently had a revocation because USCIS found that we couldn't get the NFL Players Association to issue a no objection letter. Instead, we can only get a letter saying that the player the petitioner was the team, which wasn't the case. And it's not like we need a consultation letter to say anything either way. It's almost better to have silence to get this done. But it's very challenging thing for the athlete because they want to stay in the United States, one, to train, and two, to not hold up a roster spot if there's something that happens during the season and they have to wait two or three weeks to get a visa to be eligible to play with proper work authorization. The other thing that we do is we put players on 01 visas, which do not require them to compete at all. It would be something to where we can include playing on teams as part of the itinerary. And we have been successful with players playing in NFL on an 01 visa that's based on an agent petition and it not be revoked. But we still did have problems with the consultation letter issue with the Players Association. So the reason I'm making this video is to kind of introduce the problem, show that we have already done solutions to this problem, but we could use some help helping more athletes if we were able to get this consultation letter issue rectified. And it's not even as if we need a positive letter either way on this, but it could be something where there's just no objection or just silence at all, which really gets it down is when... You know, a letter is requested and we get a letter that doesn't reflect what we requested, which is what resulted in that replication in one of the situations we're dealing with. But we're getting a lot of calls to do the same thing, and we just want to get consistent results for the players. not the ones that have been on teams, but ones that get cut, we can help them stay in status and immediately available for opportunities as well. So I hope you find this informative, and I hope that this gives more context to my inquiry and just to see if I can have a conversation with someone to try to get this rectified. Thank you very much.",,x,,,

All right, there we are. paid any attention to my page or just let me look at the camera, or if you look at it now, I've been making a big push to try to corner the market of poker-related immigration to the United States. There's a lot of poker players that live outside the United States that want to live here and play poker. It's the best place in the world to come if you're looking to do that. And so for the past probably two weeks or so, I believe. I've been putting a lot of effort in trying to see how I can funnel leads. And I want to say that we've had some success. When you flower something, eventually divine laws has got to spread some spritling. So just wanted to show you, give you some encouragement for other people out there that are trying new things and it doesn't immediately turn into something. It's just because you got to just follow the laws, keep watering the situation. It's going to work out. So for us, the best case scenario is somebody that lives outside the United States in a place where it might be tough to get a visitor visa. Maybe they've been here before and they want to come back. They have won money before and they've won tournaments. So that's exactly what I have here with this lead that just came in. That's perfect. That I wanted to show you guys. So this is a lead that came in overnight. This gentleman is from India. He says that he was in the United States in 2014. He's one of the only Indian persons to ever win a bracelet at the World Series of Pokers. And he's interested in coming back. One of the reasons why this is perfect is because we already know and can qualify what type of lead he is. You know, we can see how good he is. We can see how much money he's won. But also, since he's in India and having issues to get here, the Vita is a category that we do would alleviate those issues. We're going to suggest that he get an O one visa, which could have him here and two months. And when they go to the consulate, a lot of times they'll tell people from India and Nigeria and stuff like that. We don't believe that you'll come back to your home country after you come here. Well, if you're doing it under an 01, it's what's called dual intent, which means that they absolutely cannot stop you for that purpose. And that's why we love this so much. Let's get some more of them. Hopefully we'll have five tomorrow. This is great.",,x,,,

This is immigration attorney Sherrod Seward. If you're not familiar with me, I primarily focus on OP and EB1A visas for a lot of athletes, entertainers, investors from around the world and highly skilled professionals in all sorts of industries. But with doing so many of these visas, we can see patterns. And I must say that not only us, but there are a lot of immigration attorneys out there, even with H-1Bs, that are having major issues with USCIS and filing fees. If you're unfamiliar, on April 1st, USCIS issued some different rules regarding filing fees, including the addition of something new called an asylum fee, which asks you to pay either $300 or $600 in an additional fee based on how many full-time employees that you have. But even before that, we've been experiencing a huge delay on receipt notices being issued from USCIS when you're sending cases in, and also on the charging of credit cards that are associated with the filing fees. And all these three things together can and have resulted in a lot of delayed receipts of cases. That means that the application's done, the application is sent out, and then there's been a months long process with the file actually getting accepted. And I'm doing this video to kind of explain why our office and definitely other offices around the country have been frustrated with this. And it's really frustrating things with clients that don't understand why this is happening. So I'm going to kind of illuminate and talk on how these three different things make that happen. Okay, so first we'll just talk about mail in acceptance. When you mail a case to USCIS, if they reject it, they're not just going to send it back to you that same day. It's not uncommon to not get that file back for a month. So meanwhile, if you combine that with the fact that they're giving receipt notices late, so if you send a case and you don't get a receipt notice back, whether it's premium processing or not, for a couple of weeks or even a month out, And then you also do not see a charge on your credit card or a physical thing back. The file is just in limbo. And if you send another file on top of that, it's not uncommon to see two different cases get charged for those filing fees, because if you send a case and send one after it, they are more most more certainly going to charge you both twice for both of those filings right now. This is where the issue that comes in with the filing fees. They are getting their own rules wrong about filing fees all the time. They didn't necessarily tell anyone how to prove that a company has 25 or less employees. And sometimes even when you do, they still send it back erroneously when everything was done properly. So when that happens, you're looking at a month to two month maybe notice of that happening. Now here's another problem. Sometimes they'll say that the credit card couldn't be charged. Now here's the thing. They at first were charging the cards within the week of receiving the case. Now they are extremely inconsistent with when they will charge the card. You don't know. It could be in a week. It could be in four weeks or six weeks or things like that. But when you're dealing that or there's a card of a customer or a card of a law firm or something like that, or even a law firm, that has tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars of cases out there on a credit card. It's inconsistent of when that's going to be pulled. It makes it very frustrating to try to manage the cash flow on there of keeping limit available on that credit card. to make sure the filing fees will go out. So you can send a case and they might say, we don't think we believe what the employer size is or they got it wrong. Then it takes a month and a half or more to come and get the case back. You send it back out and then there might be an issue where they do that again or you know maybe uh there's an issue with the credit card because they're charging you know a hundred thousand dollars at the same time on cases that's been put out over the case of two months and that again kicks back to which you have to wait a week and a half and stuff like that so it's definitely a huge mesh that's a mess that's uh frustrating to absolutely everybody involved I'm sure that they're frustrated too because there's probably some people there that really like doing a good job that's fair to the filing fee payers and the taxpayers that contribute to their salaries and to the operations of the agency. But it's absolutely awful. I've never seen anything like this and it's becoming extremely common that files have to be sent out many times, which each cause like a month and a half in delay in cases that are already paid for, they are already prepared and sent out correctly. So I just like to say we empathize with everybody out there that's impacted by this, but this is just a transparent conversation on the issues of why this is happening. What are we doing as a solution? One is we're talking to other immigration attorneys and attorneys are talking to us about how to be sure to get consistent adjudication on the size of the employer. It may become the case to where we just file everybody as a large employer to avoid having the cases sent back over the $300 or so, $300, $400 in additional costs that it takes to do that. We are also going to try to figure out ways to make sure that there is proof and paper trail of the files getting there on time. For example, we like to use USPS, but it might be the case that we switched to a more expensive delivery service to make sure that USCIS has the case in hand with no excuses, right? And the other thing that we're looking at doing is making it so that the clients, especially our clients that do repeat business, we will do credit card authorizations on behalf of them. So it's not going off on a firm card or anything like that, just so that the client can be sure to keep up their limits. Because with us having so many going out, it can be kind of like hard to manage when they're so sporadic. So that's the solutions that we have in place to address this. And we're always looking for more and open to other practitioners in the industry that are having success getting consistent just receipt of cases. And it's kind of even strange to say, you know, discuss that in such detail. It's just receipt of cases when there's so many other nuances to worry about. But we're all in this fight together and we look forward to great results regardless of how disorganized or unfair USCIS will be. We'll be always fighting for advocacy and getting great results. Any questions or concerns or comments or helpful comments, you know where to find us. We're not hard to find and we look forward to your feedback. Thank you very much.",,x,,,

So we can bring in everybody. Very important stuff. Just waiting for a couple more audience members to come in. Let's see. All right, let's just get started. If you don't know, I live in Southeast United States and I run a Browns backers kind of related group in Charlotte, North Carolina, but I'm also a season ticket member to the mighty Cleveland Browns. And just like every other year, this is our year to go ahead and win that Super Bowl. But on the way there, I like to meet with a lot of friends at my own event in Charlotte and at the Cleveland Browns Stadium and my favorite, which is road trips to see where we're going and take the ministry of the Cleveland Browns across. Hopefully it's supposed to be the world because I thought we were going to get that Brazil game, but that's fine. They're missing out on us. Put it that way. So I have been purposely not looking at the schedule so I can go ahead and share what we're going to do with everybody. Everybody coming out. OK, so. Let's look at it. Got it up right here. Now we already know. There's a preseason game. I was about to say, what is that? Okay, preseason, I'm not too worried about that. Oh, but a trip to Seattle, but I'm not doing that for a regular season game. So let's look at this. Our first game is going to be at Dallas. I mean, Dallas is coming to Cleveland. People have already inquired to see if I'm going. I am selling those tickets. What I will say now is that they're at a premium price. So if you're a friend of mine inquiring about the tickets, you might want to wait two weeks because I've got them at a price to see if I can let them go for that. And if they don't go for that, I am probably going to go ahead and take this down. The next two games are important because my birthday happens to fall on September. So right here it looks like the game that corresponds with that is the Jacksonville Jaguars. So I gotta think if I'm going to go to Jacksonville or if I'm going to watch it at my spot in Charlotte. I think for this I will be in Charlotte. So game one and game two likely has me in Charlotte, whether going to Cleveland or Jacksonville. Next Sunday is in New York. That one is debatable because I do like New York. However, However, the problem is this right here. This one is absolutely going down. Sunday, September twenty ninth. I look forward to seeing everybody. And I mean, everybody at Las Vegas. I can't wait. And I know the GC over there. He'll be getting an email about that because that's what we're excited about. So I'll see everybody in Vegas on September twenty ninth. The Sunday game. A one o'clock game in Washington, DC. Well, technically Landover, Maryland. That one is a very, very attractive one to maybe go to. And between these, I'll probably choose one or the other between this Philadelphia game and the Washington game, depending on how things are looking. Cincinnati, I'll be in Charlotte or somewhere else. I am not interested in going to that game. November third, I'm actually going to be out of town, likely in a different country for a bachelor situation, not my own. I might go to this game, might sell those tickets, depending on what the price looks like. Sunday, November tenth, we're probably going out of the country. As you can see, we do not have a game either way. So that's when I like to take a vacation. Now, this one is important. We're absolutely showing up to the Superdome, New Orleans. No question. And then we have a Thursday night game versus the Steelers. That's probably going to have me there. This day at the Broncos. Oh, you know, I might be able to come to the Broncos because I think I have a a wedding in Houston on December second, December first, which is a Sunday. So I might go from there to this night game at Denver. That sounds that one sounds like a go. We're going to do that. I'm not going to Pittsburgh again. So I'll be in Charlotte for this one. Sunday, this is December. I'll see you in Charlotte. That's too cold for me. Too cold for me. Too cold for me. Maybe, depending on how the situation looks. So that's what we're going to do for today, for this season. We don't care about preseason. I'm selling the first game to the Cowboys. I'm going to do a birthday party in Charlotte for the Jacksonville game. New York, we'll see. Las Vegas, absolutely. We'll probably pick one of these games, the Washington-Philadelphia game to go to. I'm probably not going to the Cincinnati Bengals unless it's like a family situation. Well, I'll probably go to one of these games. I'll be there. This game, I will be out of the country. This is a bye. I'll probably leave too. This one, I'm going to absolutely be in New Orleans. Thursday game. That's a likely a night game. We like the Thursday game. It depends how cold it is. This one I will be at since I will be in a wedding that Sunday beforehand. Not going to Pittsburgh again. This is too cold for me selling those tickets. I'm not going to Cincinnati. Too cold and then maybe at the end of the season. So if you're interested in tickets, there you go. If you're interested in knowing when I will be in Charlotte for our events, there you go. And if I'm coming near a city by you, we can kick it. There you go as well. So happy football day, everybody. September cannot get here soon enough. Peace and happiness.",,,,,

And today we're talking about one of my favorite topics and industries, which is poker. We do a lot of visas for poker players, and we're always looking to educate the market of the best options, latest updates, and best practices for poker players looking to do their craft here in the United States, which usually means a lot of Vegas, and that's okay. Today, we're talking about the different visa categories for permanent residents. And actually, we're going to talk about one, which is the EB-A. The EB-A is appropriate for foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities. It means they have risen to the top of their field in what they do. And typically there is a couple of ways to show this. So you don't necessarily literally have to be the best person in the world at poker, but depending on your profile, it makes more sense for you to go for the EB-A rather than the other. The first thing we look at is your global poker index history to see where's your highest point that you've ranked at any one time. Now, the poker rankings for Global Poker Index go pretty high. Like we've seen them in the two hundreds of thousands of people that's been ranked. So if you're looking at being in the top three percentile is a good place to be if you're looking at your rankings. So if you've ever been anywhere, probably to six thousand in the world. But, you know, if you get much, much closer, like in like the two thousand, stuff like that, or even if you end up in the top hundred, you are a very, very good candidate for the EB-A. We might even be able to make a single, because if you've gotten that high, you usually won a big tournament. And a lot of times that big tournament can be used as a pillar piece for your EB-A arguments. Because if you have a single major award, that alone can satisfy the requirement for the EB-A self-sponsored green card. And by self-sponsored, what we mean is that you do not have to have an employer. You can just file for it by yourself, obtain it by yourself, get work authorization to do whatever you want, and then also get the green card with it. Now, if you don't have a single major award, like you haven't won a gold bracelet, World Series of Poker, any of the major tournaments like that, or even like a big cash prize tournament, like we have one client that won a million dollars at a single national tournament, but that is the type of thing that serves well in the award category eligibility. We can look at other things to look at too, especially like, do you have any special techniques that only you do? that you can articulate to USCIS. Do you have memberships within your federation or special clubs that you have entered into through your poker playing? Do you have significant earnings that are more than people in your country, not around the world, for people that have played poker? And there's some other categories, too, of which we have to prove three in EB-A to make sure that you're eligible. But if you have A question about whether you are eligible for the green card to come to United States. It's a poker player. It's really the case by case basis thing, but since that's really all we do, which is P, one Oh, one and a visas were uniquely situated to give you a. relatively accurate description of whether we think that you're likely to obtain the visa or not. So if you've got questions, if you want to know, you know who to call. Look forward to being of service to you.",,x,,,

I'm a managing partner at Sherrod Sports Visas, which is part of the innovative immigration law brand. And today I'm talking about one of my new favorites. Well, I wouldn't call it new, but it's something I like a lot and very passionate about, which is immigration for poker players, who I'm feeling personally to just be very interesting in people that I like to be around and certainly like to help them solve their immigration issues when it comes to coming to the United States, because Vegas is probably the number one place in the world to be if you're a poker player. and want to earn a consistent living pretty much on a daily basis. There's huge tournaments here in the United States and Vegas. And one of the things I want to talk about is how to change and obtain the P-one or O-one visa. So first, if you're in the United States, you're either in a couple of categories that are more common. one is if you're from like europe or australia you're probably here on an esta visa waiver which means that you came on the waiver of a requirement to have a visa The next way that just likely to come in is as a visitor, which means you have a B one or B two visa, which allow excuse me, which allows you to have up to one hundred eighty days in the country at a time. Now, a lot of people get confused because a lot of times the visitor visa will be good for ten years. But that doesn't mean you can come to the United States and stay for ten years. It means that you. over a ten-year period can come and use that visitor visa to stay at the six months at a time, usually. And the other way that's becoming more common for people to come to the United States that are interested in poker is actually F-I visas. Just to obtain access to the United States, they'll enroll in university programs so they can come on the F-I visa and then play their poker. But a lot of times they really don't want the expense of the school because they're making a lot of money making gum poker, poker prize money. So right now I'm going to talk about the process of kind of switching. So let's go to the first situation. When you're on an ESTA visa waiver, there's no visa there to change your status. So unfortunately, if you're here on an ESTA waiver and you want to obtain a P-one, you're going to have to leave the United States after your approval, go to any consulate outside the United States and come back. Well, not anyone. Depending on your nationality and the, I would say, aptitude and willingness of the consulate to take on third country nationals, you might have to work with an immigration attorney that knows consular processing to see be the best opportunity for you. For example, if you're in England, you might not want to fly all the way to England to go get your passport stamped with a P-one visa. It might be better to go to Toronto where they do accept third country nationals that are British to get their P-one visa stamped. Now, if you're here on a visitor visa, there's great news. You can change your visa from B-one to P-one without having to leave the United States. Now, if you do leave the United States, you'll need to go to a consulate to get your passport stamped with the visa, the new one, the P-one or the O-one, and come back on that. The same thing applies for the F-one visa. If you're on a student visa, you can switch to P-one or O-one, and it is our legal opinion that you can study full-time on the P-one or O-one. The trouble comes sometimes with the particular schools may be less or more comfortable with their students being on P-ones or O-ones, depending on how much they understand those visa categories. But there is guidance out there from ICE visas you can study full-time under. And it's more, more schools are getting hip to it and more comfortable with students on P-ones and O-one visas because of the NIL that's happening with the student athletes. A lot of them are turning to getting P-one and O-one visas so they can get sponsorships. So if you have a question about how to change your visa from a B-one or F-one to a P-one or O-one, whatever people to call, especially in poker. And then if you are on an ESTA visa waiver and want to get a work visa so that you can stay in the United States for a longer time and do more paid activities, we can help you, one, get approved for the visa, and then also navigate your consular processing to make it as most efficient and cost efficient as possible without you having to do crazy hoops. So I hope this was helpful, and we look forward to working with you if you are a poker player or really any athlete or entertainer or high-level professional that wants to come to the United States and obtain P-I, O-I, or EB-I-A status. Thank you very much, and until next time.",,x,,,

Now, if you look at Mr. Rubin's rankings, which are over here, okay, you'll see that it is a hundred and fifty, uh, five hundred and seventy-three, which puts them in, like, probably the top one percentile in the world when it comes to international rankings. He's also fifteenth from Russia. Now you can see what else is helpful is to see how much the all-time money earned is in the sport, which can get pretty up there. And then we also look to see the best results. So when you scroll down here, you can see like this third place finish and even the money isn't all that important as opposed to maybe the series that it's in. So this one is the World Series Circuit. There's a fourth place finish at the Wynn Signature Series. It looks like he's doing a lot more events in Vegas in person and winning pretty consistently now that he has the P-one visa. Before he was able to do this, he'd probably be doing a lot more of the online tournaments. But it's clearly clear to see that he's now living in Vegas and making money pretty much every other day. at these professional tournaments that he's going to. So we're really proud of him and what he's able to do, and very proud of our work that we do in immigration to help these poker players get access to the United States, where you can see there is steady work if you can get here to go and show your craft as a professional poker player. So if you're a poker player out there around the world and you want to come to where it's good, you know who to call. Sherrod Sports Visas, the nation's best in poker visas. Thank you very much and we look forward to working with you.",,x,,,

My name is Sherrod Seward and I'm known worldwide for being a sports-focused immigration lawyer. And today we're talking about one of our feature industries now that we're really excited about, which is poker. For the past couple of years, we've been getting a lot of increased attention on using P-one visas for poker players. Traditionally, most poker players come in on ESTA visa waivers if they are from a country like United Kingdom to where they don't have to have a visa to come to United States. They can come for sixty to ninety days. And from other countries, it's been popular to use the B-one visa to come to the United States to play poker. Now, traditionally, that's appropriate because you can accept prize money only if you want to ask the visa waiver or on a visitor visa. So you technically do not need a work visa to obtain that prize money. But nowadays, as the sport grows and it gets more popular, These wild column athletes and professional gamblers are starting to have show money to show up for certain type of events and are also starting to have sponsors and other type of businesses they do here in the United States while competing in poker. In addition, there is the thought of Vegas and some of the other towns United States are a great place to live if you're in that profession, which of course you cannot do if you're on a sixty day or a hundred eighty day visa. That's not going to permit you to live. And it's gotten to the point that we've seen a number of poker players enroll in school on F one just so they can have that access to Las Vegas and other cities they go to. One thing we want to highlight today is one of our first poker success stories, which is Yuan from China. And what's great about this particular visa category is you can be ranked pretty high, like in multiple thousands in poker and not even have very high winnings and still be appropriate to obtain a P one visa. And I'll share my screen to show you what we're talking about. So over here is Mr. Yehuan. As you can see right now, his global ranking is a hundred forty seven thousand one hundred eighty nine and his national ranking is two thousand. And here you can also see his live bet cash and things like that. And a lot of his best showings are for World Series of Poker's online championships. And you'll find sometimes he'll get like, nineteenth and sometimes he'll get first in a tournament. And even with this kind of background, we were able to get him the P-one visa. And the reason why he wanted one is because in a lot of countries, they don't have access to ESTA visa waivers. And also they do not have access to they don't have access to visitor visa appointments. For example, in countries such as India, you might be looking at over a year to get a visitor visa appointment, the same as countries like China, where they don't, one, cannot get an ESTA visa waiver, and two, it's really in a, It takes way too long to get a visitor visa. When you have P ones and O visas in the same country where it might be a year to wait for a visitor visa, you can get appointments in a couple of days or a week. And even if they are a month out, we're very proficient at getting expedited appointments. So you can really get access to the United States within a month or two using premium processing. But I think this is a great success story that shows that there's a lot of people in the world that are eligible for P-one visas as poker players, even if you haven't won major tournaments or won a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. So please skip us a mind if you're a poker player and you want to come to the United States to play poker. We can certainly help you and you don't have to have much accolades for us to do it. So we look forward to working with you. And then until next time.",,x,,,

And each year there's far more applicants for this visa category than there are visas available, often by over one hundred thousand visa applications. So one of the things we know is that there's going to be some disappointed individuals as they find out that they did not get selected for the lottery process. And it's not even just those individuals that are gonna be impacted and affected, but also the companies that filed for these benefits, well filed for these beneficiaries to take part of the organization as a lot of time and also resources went into those filings. One thing we're approaching and trying to educate the market in is that sometimes H-Bs might be better in the O-Category. We've been doing a lot of research time to find out one is if the O-Category is going to be a good category in data science. artificial intelligence and other tech-related industries, and also looking at the EB-II national interest waiver to where persons that might not have gotten the H-I-B can apply for either one of these categories almost without the employer being not associated with an employer. and obtain work authorization that they can come back to those organizations or even other organizations based on the skill sets that they have. There is a push, especially with artificial intelligence, which often includes data scientist persons, to get the best minds in the world, in the United States. And what we're doing is leading the pact when it comes to making these petitions under the old category and these industries to get it down to a science to figure out what the do adjudication officers look for when it comes to a strong application in this process and if they have certain nuances that they're looking for to make it easier to fit these minds and great skill sets under the categories of o-one a o-one b and as we said eb-one a and eb-two national interest waiver So one of the things we're doing is offering special programs where we're giving free consultations or evaluations to people in these fields, especially those that have been denied the H-B by the lottery process. And we're also going to employers that employ people in data. in artificial intelligence and also other tech related things to talk to them about the frustrations they have with the H-I-B. Let's get an idea of what their candidates look like and the intensity of the problems that they're trying to solve with these great minds and personnel, and then also offer a contingent situation to where we'll file visas for people they're interested in, and if we're unsuccessful, provide a legal feedback just because we're so one confident in our skill set and two willing to get um more cases in so that we can learn the nuances of applying our program in o-one and eb-one a visa writing to this important industry that there's a push for us to get the best minds here the united states and keep them here with the proper work authorization So if you're an AI or a data scientist, personnel from around the world, you're interested in coming to the United States, or if you're an employer that employs these people or might need to employ them in the future, please get with our tech department, our immigration tech department, so that we can see if we are willing to bring you into one of our special programs that makes it very easy to get some legal support. in these categories so I hope you found this helpful and hopefully we can helpful hopeful sorry a lot of h's that we can be helpful for you in the near future",,x,,,
"April.16, 2024",Updated Fees P-1_ O-1 & EB-1A Discussion with Sherrod Seward_ Esq_,Business Development or Marketing,Updated Fees P-1_ O-1 & EB-1A Discussion with Sherrod Seward_ Esq_,Updated Fees P-1_ O-1 & EB-1A Discussion with Sherrod Seward_ Esq_.mp4,Updated Fees P-1_ O-1 & EB-1A Discussion with Sherrod Seward_ Esq_.mp3,"How's it going? My name is Sherrod Seward and I'm known around the world for my work in P. one. Oh, one and a visa petitions for athletes, entertainers and executives from all over the world. And if you don't know by now, there's been an increase a significant increase in fees over this year for and filing the visa petitions and also. a very, very recent increase in the regular processing fees on April first, two thousand twenty four. For us, when we first started, I believe you could get a premium processing case out the door for around like twelve hundred dollars. And since then, The prices have never dropped and have unfortunately only gone higher, which is now starting to get to the point where it's pricing out a lot of individual athletes and entertainers that have aspirations of coming to the United States and practicing their trade. Mind you, when we're doing our visa categories, we're not doing H-B. Ours are really different. dedicated to top flight professionals that they can prove whether it be through athletics, business or arts, that they are amongst the best in the world at what they do. So to go over where the kind of current fees are and how much they've increased, the regular processing fees at the start of the year for P-one and O-one visa petitions were four hundred and sixty dollars. They're now up to one thousand fifteen and one thousand fifty five respectively, which is almost well, it's over and one hundred percent fee increase. In addition, we saw premium processing, which was already above two thousand dollars, go all the way up to twenty eight hundred twenty eight oh five. So two thousand eight hundred and five dollars. So if you're looking at getting a premium premium processing case out the door off rip, you're looking at almost four thousand dollars in filing fees, just government fees before you even get into the attorney fees. Second, the government has added an asylum fee, which is a fee that they'll collect to go and support the fees that are the cost of, I guess, defending the border, whether it be through the ICE officers that are on the ground and for the inclusion of more judges to more readily adjudicate asylum cases and other border-related cases in an expeditious manner. So if you are self-petitioned, which would be if you're like an EB-A or if you're getting filed for by an organization or an individual that is either nonprofit or under twenty five employees, you're now looking at a three hundred dollar asylum fee that will go along with your visa petition fees. In addition to that, you will if you are above the twenty five level, when it comes to your full-time employees and you are not a non-profit you're now looking at six hundred dollars in the silent fees so worst case scenario you're looking at your regular processing fee which is now above a thousand dollars your premium processing fee which is almost three thousand dollars and a six hundred dollar asylum fee for getting petitions out the door. And that's before you even have your legal fees, which typically should be at least two times what the filing fees are, which is, of course, going to price a lot of people out of the market when it comes to obtaining these visas and even be a big kind of pressure on organizations that usually rely on getting a consistent amount of visas done. against their margins in sports such as combat sports or even individual sports such as track and field, where there's a lot of students that are looking to graduate and then take advantage of obtaining a work visa in these categories. There is litigation out there, especially right before the fees are supposed to be in place to see if they can get an injunction on having these additional fees. As you can see, to the date of this recording, which is April sixteenth, there has not been a successful litigation to get a preliminary injunction on these increased in fees. The other thing that happens in a practical thing is when there's a big change with USCIS and fee related, there starts to be a lot of rejections of filings, which can really frustrate lawyers and our clients, because even though a case is ready to go, if we send the package there and the forms or the way the payments are issued are not exactly how USCIS likes or if it's correct according to the information that's available to us. If they don't accept the filing, a lot of times they don't charge their credit cards associated with those filings for weeks. And then if they decide to reject it, you will not get that file back for maybe a month. So even though you've sent a case out, it has everything that it needs and you've spent your time on it, you might not find that there's a problem with it for a month. And a lot of times clients might want to send another case package, but then we've seen situations where multiple filing fees have been pulled out just because the government either took its time or accepting a case and giving a receipt notice, or there's been some type of back and forth and confusion on what the new fees applied and things of that nature. So when there's change with USCIS, it's best to take your time and get the original filing in, make sure it got there before you start sending multiple files, just because there tends to be a A little bit of chaos, honestly, when there's such changes that honestly seem pretty abrupt. But that's our discussion on the increase in fees on P-ones and O-one visas. Also, the cost of EB-one A's are Pretty much similar. The filing fees went up fifteen dollars on regular processing. Premium processing is the same twenty eight oh five as the P one and oh one cases. And the asylum fee does apply. So if you're doing as a self sponsored, then our. knowledge right now is that you'll pay the three hundred dollars you still do have to pay even though you're not an employer but as a self-petitioned eb-one a as far as we have information our stance is that uscs is requiring that three hundred dollar asylum fee to be submitted with your i-one forty hope this was beneficial to you I'm sorry that the price is going up but that's what we're dealing with today and we hope to guide you through it have a good day",,x,,,
"April.16, 2024",FOIA Request and Litigation with the Environmental Protection Agency,Business Development or Marketing,FOIA Request and Litigation with the Environmental Protection Agency,FOIA Request and Litigation with the Environmental Protection Agency.mp4,FOIA Request and Litigation with the Environmental Protection Agency.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward, and I am a Freedom of Information Act litigation attorney. Traditionally, I learned my practice of law in immigration, where we did a lot of P. one O one and one a visa petitions for some of the best athletes, entertainers and sports executives in the world. And we got started in this business because we were getting inconsistent results in the adjudication of our cases, and we didn't have the transparency to know who was making these decisions, what was the consistency in training of these individuals, and if there was any type of collaboration within the agency, which this case was the Department of Homeland Security, to systematically treat our law firm and or our clients differently. Through going through this, we went through everything from filing the normal freedom of information request through their online portal, all the way down to litigation on behalf of our clients and on behalf of our loan firm. And it was able to obtain a lot of great results that not only kept us in business and getting fair results for our clients, but also provided good information for the industry to know when it comes to how government agencies make their decisions. At the end of the day, all of these decisions are made by people who can make mistakes and have biases and other things that we are not privy to, but we can get that information. Today, I'm talking about the Environmental Protection Agency and FOIA requests with this organization, which can be very important. The EPA, as it is known, does the enforcement of environmental related issues. And it does a lot of studies on pollution and things of that nature that are very important to everyone. So what we do here is we help clients do everything from submit their initial FOIA requests with the EPA, which out of these could use a lot of specificity, just because you're asking for a lot of maybe technical information or even sensitive information to where some of it could be trade secrets. Some of it could be related to privacy concerns and the interests of third party contractors. And some of it can be pretty politically motivated to not be out there if they can help it. But what we do is we help clients go to the appropriate portal, maybe the mail, tailor make these requests so that it should be responded to with positive feedback from the agency. Now, when you submit a FOIA request that's properly filed, the government should respond to you within twenty days. If they do not, you automatically have the option to go file for that information in federal court, which is something that we like to do as opposed to just keep following up with them, because typically they're going to provide you the information or not. If so much time passes and they either do not give an administrative Decision and ask for you to appeal it or if they say that the information is outside the scope and they have waivers and information available to them are tools that they can use to Redact or just keep out a lot of the information that you're seeking you can even do that So partial if they give you partial information, you can also litigate to get the full extent of the information that you're seeking so typically To reiterate, our process goes from helping our clients file a specific and detailed FOIA request that's likely to avoid the reasons that they cannot divulge information. Second, we look to see if twenty days pass without giving the information, flat out denying the information or giving a partial disclosure. From there, depending on what happened, if nothing happened, we can go straight to litigation to where we can file a complaint and a lot of times get the information you're seeking or at least there'll be a back and forth where we do motions with the other party or to help file an administrative appeal to get that partial disclosure opened up or get information at all if they didn't provide anything and again when we do these appeals it starts the clock again to where we can wait twenty days and take it to the court which is always good because it's like having a referee You know, when you're going at the agency and keep asking for the same information, it's the same people as the decision maker. But when you bring in a third party court and especially if the request is fair and in the EPA, you can ask a lot of things like compliance and enforcement records. You can ask for environmental data for the studies that they do. Sometimes you can get internal communications if you think that there's been bias put against you and that process that they did to make their decision making. Say, for example, if you're trying to open plants and stuff like that and you're finding that you have a hard time getting permits, and wonder if there's something behind it, the FOIA request might be a great way to really go ahead and find out. You could also find information about policy drafts if there's policy that comes out that you might think didn't have much thinking behind it. You can go ahead and try to get those notes to see if that's true or not. Very few valuable information. But there are things to where you can't get the information. So if something's classified, the FOIA request is not going to get it. If there's personal privacy information, so you can't get the address and phone numbers of people that's made decisions on your on your uh your situations so don't try that and then also there are some of the internal um communications that they have are considered privileged for example if they're gearing up for law enforcement and it's done with their prosecuting attorneys there's attorney client privilege that can happen within the government and also there's uh trade secrets that are usually not able to find out for example if they're working with contractors and they have um a contract to do certain things that might end up being classified or military based or just things that they're keeping internal. There are situations where you can't get that information because the trade secret is very important to that third party contractor that was working on that specific project. But other than that, there is a lot of information out there that we can get with the right aggression. and keeping the government honest is good for everybody. So if you are interested in getting a FOIA request or FOIA litigation involved with the EPA, do not hesitate to contact our offices. We're always here to help you. Thank you very much.",,,,,

And we've been fortunate enough to have several situations where we learned a lot from filing federal litigation against USCIS and some of the decisions made against the cases and also had the opportunity to file a lot of FOIA requests with the USCIS as well, to which we didn't really have great results at first. It used to be the case that when you had a a situation where a case was denied, you're able to see the adjudicating officer's number, not their name, on the forms of the denial or even on RFEs. As years went along, this started disappearing at the Vermont Service Center and then at the California Service Center, to which you used to be able to file an email to own a premium processing case. number of the of the adjudicator to which years ago they would go ahead and respond with that number which has a lot of important purposes to you can see that a lot of at the end of the day these decisions are made by people and some of these people are fair and some of them might not as be might might not be as uh fair of others so the litigation or the FOIA request allows you to see if you have a pattern of denials by the same person we've had conversations with attorneys that operate in the same space where we have identified where there are situations where adjudicating officers, the same one, are making the same kind of decisions. So what we decided to do for our own law firm, because we were having issues with USCIS, is file a FOIA request on behalf of the law firm to seek information on all of our cases that had negative results just so we could see all at once if there were patterns in who was denying those cases. Of course, we were met with a swift denial of all the information from USCIS FOIA department to which we immediately filed an appeal. The reason we did this is because there are twenty days to which the government can withhold that information before they're eligible to be litigated on that issue. The only way for them to extend that time is to do the denial and ask if you want to appeal, because if you go to court before appealing, you will not have exhausted all your remedies and the case will likely be dismissed. So one service we're excited about offering is the same thing we did for ourselves, which is we're looking to work with other attorneys, especially in industries such as immigration law or other regulatory-based practices where the decision-making is given by the federal government to do litigation on your behalf. We can take a list of adverse situations that you think might not be unfair And we can go and see and get the back end information on that, whether it be communication between different officers on that, which we have found. And to see if there are bias between who's been adjudicating your cases against others to see if that person has a more aggressive response. uh route when it comes to adjudicating the cases before them or to see if there's something specifically wrong with their relationship with your either your law firm or your client because at the end of the day these people are individuals and individuals make mistakes and can have certain feelings but we as on the private side oftentimes do not have the ability to see the names or congruencies in the even adjudication numbers of the people making these decisions. That's why we do FOIA litigation on behalf of ourselves, and we're looking to do FOIA litigation on behalf of our peers. I think it's a great service that we can all learn a lot and keep the government on their toes with transparency, which is good for everybody. We look forward to working with you. If you have any questions or inquiries or like to get started, do not hesitate to contact us. I appreciate your time.",,,,,
"April.16, 2024",FOIA Litigation Lawyers,Business Development or Marketing,FOIA Litigation Lawyers,FOIA Litigation Lawyers.mp4,FOIA Litigation Lawyers.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward and I am an attorney that does a lot of immigration work with athletes and entertainers and executives. But I also do FOIA, Freedom of Information Act request litigation. A lot of times when you're dealing with government agencies, it can be frustrating when you get certain results or even partial results and you don't get explanations why. This is very particular, a big problem in immigration to where you might not get benefit of certain immigration services and you don't get an explanation of why that was. Using FOIA requests, which again is the Freedom of Information Act, uh you can and should be entitled to information that is transpiring with the government including the file that they have on you and perhaps even information about the communications they had regarding you because at the end of the day the government agencies that you work with for whether it be immigration benefits or if you're looking at the Department of Commerce for certain types of trade related data is publicly available information that is controlled by individuals. And sometimes they get it right. Sometimes they get it wrong. But either way, a lot of this information you are entitled to. The process starts with making a well put together request to the appropriate agency. Now, if they do not get back to you within 20 days, it is possible to go ahead and file for that information in federal court to go and obtain the information that you seek. If it's the case that the government does respond, but they either deny or not give you adequate information, you're usually able to appeal that decision, which again starts the clock for the 20 days that you must sit and wait before that you're able to go to federal court and ask for those documents and information. So the appeal process, you must do it before you sue so you exhaust your remedies. Otherwise, if you go to court before doing that and there is an appeal on the books, you will likely get your case dismissed because the remedies were not exhausted. However, if you have 20 days passed and you did not get the information, and also if you have 20 days passed after giving an appeal and they still do not give the information, litigation is a great way forward. At our offices, we charge a flat fee for getting started with that. That will take you all the way through the whole process. If it ends up taking us more time, we do have the leeway to go to the court and ask for additional fees if additional time was spent on it. That's not something that we'll collect from the client. Typically, the entire process is handled through paperwork, which is filing the complaint and then responding to summary judgments, requests and things of that nature that can go on. A lot of the time, the government is willing to just give the information without spending too much time and resources on that. the appeal process and going back and forth with the court documents, so it can be an extremely great way to get inside information. Again, where this is commonly pursued is in immigration benefits if somebody gets denied or even on behalf of law firms, When they are doing business with regulatory concerns, such as if I'm an immigration attorney dealing with USCIS, you can file for a FOIA request based on all of the cases that you might have some issues with with USCIS to see if there's some bias. Other ways where this is applicable is if you're trying to get information from the Department of Commerce on certain attendees to conferences, or even if you're dealing in government contracting and you want to get some more transparency on bid processes that you think might have not been fair. The FOIA request is an excellent way to get this information. And litigation is a great way to, one, get the information that you need, and two, do a public duty in service of keeping the government open and transparent. If you have any questions about FOIA requests or litigation, do not hesitate to contact us. We're glad to help and have free consultations on many times for these type of issues. Have a great day, and we hope to hear from you.",,,,,
"April.16, 2024",Contingent Based Talent Based Residence Services,Business Development or Marketing,Contingent Based Talent Based Residence Services,Contingent Based Talent Based Residence Services.mp4,Contingent Based Talent Based Residence Services.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward of Sherrod Sports Visas and Innovative Immigration Law. We're known worldwide for our work in P101 and EB1A visas that we've worked with over the years for some of the best athletes, entertainers, and sports executives from all over the world. Most recently, we're using these visa categories to offer a unique experience to persons usually looking to immigrate to the United States via investment. Instead, we are offering a special contingent-based program, which is on a flat fee basis, to do it based on talent migration. A lot of people that are coming to the United States like to take advantage of the EB-5 investment visa, which usually requires investment of at least $800,000 and can sometimes be a lot more into the United States economy in order to participate in this EB-5 process, which could take a long time if you're outside of the United States, for example. if you're in a country such as China, it could take up to a year and a half for a visa to become available in order to take advantage of the EB-5 investment program and come over into the United States if you do not have another non-immigrant visa status to do that with. Instead, what we offer is we use the O-1 visa category, the EB-2 national interest waiver category, and the EB-1A to get ultimate results for persons that try to take advantage of our flat fee based talent-based migration services. What happens here is we charge a flat rate, which right now is $40,000, and we will file all of these types of visas based on your certain circumstances and how fast you want to get to United States so that you don't have to worry about which category do you fit in best. A lot of times we are finding that there might be a candidate that might be good for 01A versus 01B. Do they want to do the 01 just to get into the country and then do their EB1A after that? So it turns on. time of access, and also getting the permanent residents attached. With this program, we'll use whatever category we can. So you have the ability to have us file for an 01A, 01B, EB2, National Interest Waiver, and EB1A, all of that for the same price. And we keep going and trying until you get the results that you're looking for, which is one, swift access to the United States, which we can do under the O-1 visa. A lot of people that are great business persons and have done well at life are eligible for O-1 visas, and that can get you access and even tough to get interview countries such as India and China in the United States within a month or a month and a half, depending on how fast the application process goes. After that, once you're inside the United States, we can file for EB1A and adjustment of status that will get you the permanent residence much sooner and much cheaper than the EB5 program. Because unlike the EB5 program, there is no minimum investment that needs to be done to take advantage of 01As and EB categories. Additionally, there is no source of funds typically required. So where did you get money from? It's really based on your background in Acumen as a one, an individual that has awards or maybe you have started a business that has awards or you've done certain things within your industry that are unique in your side of the world. Either way, this process begins with an executive consultation where we'll send an intake sheet to where you can put your background of you or maybe another member in your family to see who has the best story to be told to get the ultimately EB1A or National Interest Waiver exception. And from there, we'll outline what visa applications we think should be filed on your behalf to get the quickest and most desired result possible. Now, how does the contingency based part of it work? We are so confident in the clients that we choose to take advantage of this program that we have a refund program available to clients if they're somehow unsuccessful. So if we can't get you to the United States and everything gets disavowed, we have a program to refund you the legal fees paid onto it. So if something gets denied, you can either ask for a refund or we give you options to file a different type of appeals based on it. But ultimately, it is possible to get your filing fees and I mean, not filing fees, but your legal fees back if we're unsuccessful getting you to the country on the O-1 visa programs. And if the green card applications fail as well. That's how confident that we are in our skill set and that more migration investment-based mindsets should be looking at the talent-based visa categories to obtain permanent residency in the United States quickly and without having to do the significant investments that come with the other categories. And so their family members can do things as get work authorization and attend schools full-time in the united states much simpler and faster than doing the eb-5 investment program so I hope that this is received well for our contingent base and flat rate services to where we will use all of our skill sets and the visa categories available to us to get you and your family in the united states without the use of the eb-5 program and we'll do that at a success fee that we will return fees if we're not successful. If you have any questions, please just do not hesitate to schedule a special consultation with this because this goes to the top level of the firm that does these type of consultations to make sure that you are a great candidate for this program. Thank you very much, and we look forward to working with you or your clients.",,,,,
"April.16, 2024",Welcome to the Drafting Process - Innovative Immigration Law,Client Correspondence,Welcome to the Drafting Process - Innovative Immigration Law,Welcome to the Drafting Process - Innovative Immigration Law.mp4,Welcome to the Drafting Process - Innovative Immigration Law.mp3,"Hello. Congratulations on becoming one of our clients or returning as one of our clients. We certainly appreciate your business and value your support and trust in us and being one of the best law firms in the country when it comes to P.O. and EB1A based immigration petitions. So what I'm going to do now, and I'm Sherrod Seward. is I'm going to give you a general overview of what to expect going forward for your visa application, which is likely in the P0 or EB1A visa category. Each of these requires extensive brief, which is usually a document that is probably almost two dozen pages, sometimes even more, where we discuss how you're eligible for the visa category you're seeking, and also a very extensive amount of documentation to prove each category that we're arguing on your behalf for these visas. So let's go through it. The first thing we need to talk about is what happens once the engagement letter and invoice are signed. When that happens, your case is then referred to the drafting team to where they begin working on your visa. And they will begin writing your visa process based on the information they already have and information that is available on the internet. However, ultimately it is up to the client or petitioner to provide the documentation necessary to put forth the best arguments. Since we have so much experience in doing these visa applications, we have a unique understanding of what documentation is considered very persuasive in your case. So while the team will draft from information that's available to them, typically they'll come and let you know what type of documentation they need to make those arguments. And usually once a week you'll get an update once a draft is attempted to see if any more documentations are required. Without proper documentation, you must know that your application is severely weakened and that will delay filing. So a lot of times if a case is taking a long time to get out the door, it's because we are not getting the documentation required for a strong argument in your petition. So be sure to get the documents responsibly. and responsively, so that means get good documentation and get it quickly to the drafting team so they can get your file out the door as soon as possible. Okay, next is communications. We understand that clients have a lot of questions and that may come up during the process, whether that be from the time that a visa is filed to the time that it's getting out the door. The communication plan is, very specifically laid out in the engagement letter, which I suggest that you look at and so that you know. Because a lot of times if we have clients that contact every day during a time where an application is pending, it's going to probably incur unwanted fees just because That's not what this process is about. The fees are paid to get the file out. However, if you do have additional questions beyond the filing of the visa, there's a process for that that's outlaid in the engagement letter. Furthermore, when your file is processing, you will get a receipt number and instructions on how you can check that status on USCIS. So there's no need for you to wait on a response for the firm or engage extra billing from multiple communications to the firm. when the receipt number and online status update are readily available to you. And then you also will get access to discount consultations if you have follow-up questions beyond the preparation of your visa application. Timetables. When it comes to drafting, a lot of the timetable will depend on the client. When we have the documentation we need for strong arguments, then the drafts go out the door sooner than later. And of course, we are more interested in having quality applications out rather than bare bone applications that will incur a request for evidence rather than a swift approval. The other thing to understand is once a case is filing or really sent out of the door, there's a couple of things that's really outside of the immigration law offices services. For one, the USCIS tends to take a long time now issuing receipt notices and also charging the credit cards involved with filing. So when we file the visa, We use our credit cards to make the filing fee payments. That's just so that we can tell earlier when we can expect a receipt notice. Nowadays, especially with the change in pricing, there's a lot of confusion on USCIS with what filing fees apply and how soon they swipe those credit cards for receipt notices. So that's why right now we like to be very careful and take our time with sending out the visa applications, especially during this time where the new fees are in place, to make sure we get consistent receipts from USCIS. Because if the filing is... you know not accepted for a reason we won't know for weeks so even though if we sent a file out on the first we might not find out that it was not uh receded until the first of the next month just because of how uscis is uh responding right now so Once it's pending, we don't have any control over how long it takes them to make decisions on it. If you have premium processing and you have a receipt notice, then they have a duty within 15 business days to issue its kind of response. During that time, there's nothing we can do to speed that up. If you have a regular processing case, there's really nothing we can do to speed that up. The USCIS can take as long as they like to make a decision on that. And it's up to the client to decide if they want to add premium processing to get a swifter decision. So I hope just to reiterate, one is very important to get the documents that are responsible and responsive to the team for drafting to get files out the door as soon as possible. Communications are clearly outlined in your engagement letter. Items about things that are in furtherance of just sending the visa petition out are more appropriate for a follow-up consultation, which there's a discounted link that will be made available to you as an existing client. Timetables, we do not have control over how long USCIS takes to make a decision, but that can be augmented with adding premium processing to certain type of cases. And usually in P-1, O-1 and EB-1A, that's always, available to you. From there, you'll get a receipt notice that you can look to always just check online to see what your status is. And then for additional services, remember that you'll be brought through a current client portal to get access to discount consultations to further those conversations. I hope this is helpful. And we are so glad that you're looking to do your visa petition with us. And we hope for a great result. You have a great day.",,,,,
"April.16, 2024",EB-1A Filing Fees and Process Explained - Innovative Immigration Law,Other Video,EB-1A Filing Fees and Process Explained - Innovative Immigration Law,EB-1A Filing Fees and Process Explained - Innovative Immigration Law.mp4,EB-1A Filing Fees and Process Explained - Innovative Immigration Law.mp3,"Hello, this is Sherrod Seward at Sherrod Sports Visas and Innovative Immigration Law. And I first would like to congratulate you on being deemed an excellent candidate for the EB-A visa. What that means is based on our previous experience, we think you have at least an eighty five percent chance of succeeding with this visa, usually much higher. But that's just how we like to express it based on our previous experience in the visa category, considering your industry. And right now I'm going to kind of talk about the fee process and how it works. Generally, the fees for the legal side are a flat fee for the process. And then you have to consider filing fees. After April first, two thousand twenty four, the filing fees for this visa category has gone up. And I'm going to discuss those in details so that you know your options. So, when you're dealing with the, you have the option of this is if you're in the United States of filing it by itself and seeing if it's approved and then filing for your adjustment of status. If you already know that you want to apply for adjustment of status. then you can apply for both at the same time. You do not have to wait for an EB-A approval before you go and apply for your permanent residence, also known as a green card. You can do that at the same time if you're here in the United States. First, I'm going to discuss the filing fees associated with the EB-A first and then get into the green card process. So the first thing they'll always be is a regular processing fee. The regular processing fee for EB-A is seven hundred fifteen dollars. And it usually takes a long time to hear back on these on regular processing. which is usually eight to twelve months is when you can expect to hear a natural response on regular processing. Now, this is a long time to wait, but it may make sense to do that if you're filing for adjustment of status because it's going to take a long time for that to be approved anyway. So you might as well, if you're going to file at the same time, just use regular processing. The other fee that you'll always have now is the new asylum fee, which is a fee based on the size. Well, I guess for EB-A, it's always going to be the lower fee, which is three hundred dollars. So you're going to always pay seven hundred fifteen dollars and the three hundred asylum fee regardless if you're filing an EB-A. The next thing you can look at is adding premium processing. Premium processing is an additional fee to this that goes to the government and allows you to get responses within fifteen business days on the EB-A application, which means in fifteen business days or less, USCIS needs to either approve the petition or give an other type of notice. In addition, when you do this, you get the opportunity to be able to email USCIS directly about the petition, which a lot of times can come in handy, just having that extra communication. Now, I will say I do recommend EB-A only if you're not filing for adjustment of status at the same time because you'll just kind of waste the premium processing fee since you're going to wait for the green card process to go anyway. So if you are filing your adjustment of status at the same time as your EB-A, then it makes sense to use regular processing and forego the premium processing fee. Next, we're gonna talk about the processing fees and options for obtaining the green card. Once you're approved for EV-A, you are eligible to adjust to being a permanent resident in the United States by two ways. One is you can adjust your status while you're inside the United States, or you can consular process by going to a national visa center outside of the United States to do an interview process in order to get that paperwork done, okay? So if you're in the United States, I'll break down the process. You'll need to pay a standard fee for Form I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I- And if you have dependents in there, for example, if you have senior citizens or children under fourteen, then their filing fees are around eight hundred dollars. So for the adults, you'll pay fourteen forty. And then for kids, if you have them under fourteen, they'll pay a lesser price of around seven hundred fifty to eight hundred dollars for their application. Now, in addition to that, there's two other applications that are very important when you're adjusting status. One is form I- one one thirty one, which is also known as advanced parole travel document. Once you have this, this means you can travel in and out of the United States while your permanent residence case is pending. OK. And usually it takes around six months or more for this to come in. So if you're looking to adjust status in the United States, you must be ready to stay in the United States for six months or more at a time so that you get your travel document back. Because if you leave the country while it's pending without advanced parole, which is for form I- then you risk losing the whole application for adjustment of status. So if you do have to be back and forth, I would suggest doing consular processing so you can do that at your own convenience and know when it's going to happen for that interview. And the next way to do it is consular processing. Consular processing has a much lower filing fee, which is three hundred and twenty five dollars for family based petitions. That means if you're doing something to where you marry somebody and you get it that way. And for what we usually do, which is employment base, which is the same as EB-A, you're looking at a filing fee of three hundred and forty five dollars. In consular processing, what happens is we wait until you're approved, and then we gather documents and send it to a national visa center where we negotiate back and forth with them about different documents they want to see, whether it be financial documents, background about your history of owning property, employment history, things like that, to get the green light to get an interview with them once a visa is available. Usually there's a certain schedule to what visas are available in different countries that determine how long it will take to get an interview for you for that. And it's something that you can't see until you start the process. All right. So to really reiterate, EB-A, regular processing fees as of April first, two thousand twenty four is seven hundred fifteen dollars. The asylum fee program, if you're using EB-A, you're usually self-sponsored, which means it's going to be the smaller fee of three hundred. So right now for regular processing, EB-A is seven hundred fifteen plus three hundred dollars. And then if you're looking to add premium processing, which we only suggest if you're not going to file your adjustment status at the same time or console process, is twenty eight oh five. Other than that, if you're looking to adjust status here in the United States while you're doing your EB-A, the standard fee is fourteen hundred forty dollars. The application fee for advanced parole, which is the right to travel back and forth while your application is pending, is six hundred thirty dollars. And the employment card, which allows you to work, which also takes around six to eight months, is two hundred and sixty dollars, whether it's filed online or by paper. And these are all things that we usually file at the same time for speed of getting that back. And if you're looking to consular process, which gets your green card outside of the United States, then the filing fee is three hundred forty five for the EB-A self-sponsored category. I know this is all confusing, and that's why we'll have it on our website so you can see the price in front of you. And we look forward to being serviced to you. And congratulations on your determination that you are a great candidate for the EB-A visa.",,,,,
"April.16, 2024",P-1 Visas Fees and Pricing Explained,Other Video,P-1 Visas Fees and Pricing Explained,P-1 Visas Fees and Pricing Explained.mp4,P-1 Visas Fees and Pricing Explained.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward, sports immigration lawyer here at Sherrod Sports Visas and Innovative Immigration Law. And first, I'd like to congratulate you If you're seeing this video, you have been confirmed that you are a great candidate for a P1 visa, which is appropriate for internationally recognized athletes. That means based on our previous experience of many, many hundreds of approvals in this category, we deem your likely of success at least 85%. It's really usually much higher based on all the visas we've done before. And right now this video is to kind of break down the pricing, especially when it comes to filing fees and the legal fees. So the legal fees are expressed to you and there are flat fee based. They are due in their totality before we file the visa. Typically it does not take us long time to prepare the visa application, so the legal fees are usually due up front and we try to have the petition out as soon as possible. Now, the filing fee portion of this has become a little bit more complicated due to fee changes that took place on April 1st, 2024. And I'm going to break those filing fees down. So for a P1 visa, the regular processing price, which is the government fee that gets you usually three to five month responses is $1,015. Next, you have the option of whether to file premium processing, which will give you 15 day responses. And that's business days now from USCIS, which means they have up to 15 days to give you either an approval or another type of notice. Otherwise, they'll have to return the premium processing fees. Right now, as of April 1st, 2024, the premium processing fees are $2,805. So to use the premium processing service, you'll need to do the $115 for regular processing. In addition to that, the $2,800. Next, as far as government fees, there is the new asylum fee, which goes to help support, I guess, the asylum process and hire more judges and officers in that type of law enforcement. Now, there's two options for these, and it's really not set on anything that you do, but just the size of the petitioner. How many full-time employees does the petitioner, the entity that's signing on the paperwork, have? If it's more than 25 employees full-time, then the asylum fee is an additional 600. If the entity is nonprofit or has less than 25 full-time employees, then the cost is $300. So to reiterate, regular processing for P1A visas is $1,015. Premium processing is an additional $2,805. And then you have the asylum fee, which is either $300 if you are 25 employees or less or nonprofit, or 600 if you are a larger organization that has more than 25 employees. And that culminates the filing fee issue when it comes to P1A visas. The only thing that else that might come up to getting the visa out the door would be if you do not have a petitioner. If you do not have an entity that can sign off or a person in the United States citizen that can sign off on your paperwork, your form I-129 serving as the petitioner or sponsor. Both mean the same thing. Then you have the opportunity to use a talent agency that we like to use, which charges $2,000 per application and then has some help commission based things that they do when they find opportunities for you that are paid. Because nowadays, if you're going to use a petitioning agency, it's best practice to use a talent agency that's going to actively trying to find you things and gigs rather than just be passive as USCIS has become more aggressive on that. And that concludes our breakdown on the P1A pricing. Nowadays, I'm sorry that it's so expensive, but that's where we are. And I hope that you learned a lot from this video. We look forward to being of service to you. Thank you very much.",,,,,

My name is Sherrod Seward, and I'm one of the partners here at Innovative Immigration Law, also known as Sherrod Sports Visas. We're known worldwide for our work in cricket immigration, specifically with working with the US Masters T10 League and the owners, players, and executives within that. We understand that there's a lot of major tournaments that are going to be taking place in the United States, ranging from the World Cup to the Major Cricket League and also the second in our season of the US Masters T10. And we get a lot of inquiries from around the world of how to attend these events, not as athletes, but as spectators. And right now, as you know, the best way to get the appropriate visa to come for these purposes is the visitor visa. Unfortunately, in many of the countries where cricket is most popular, such as Pakistan and India, the wait times for visitor visas is quite long. And for that reason, we have developed a package, a series of services that we offer to persons that are interested in coming to the United States to view these events to get the best chance of being able to make that happen despite the interview times of the visitor visas being so long if you haven't started the process. The first process that we offer is for persons that are highly talented or doing very well in business. you have the opportunity to obtain an O-1 visa, which is for, it's actually a work visa, but it's used to speed up your access to the United States. The wait time for O visas is very short, and we can also get them expedited, typically to three weeks out from approval. And another thing about the O-1 visa is that it's dual intent, which means that you will avoid situations at the consulate where they say you are going to be denied, even when you have an approved visa petition, because you do not have enough ties to your home country or some of the other popular reasons that consular officers deny approved visas for nationals in India and Pakistan at the consulate every day. The second option is we will hands-on apply for a B1 or B2 visa on your behalf. This service involves us actually filling out the forms for the DS-160, setting an appointment on your behalf, and doing our special expedited processing with the consulate directly to try to give you the best chance of getting a one timely interview with an approved expedited, and then also putting your best foot forward to give you the best chance of having success at that visa interview. The process involves us doing the DS-160, working the appointment portal, providing a letter of invitation from one of our affiliated sports consultancy agencies, and also dealing directly with the consulate to let them know via email what the situation is and the urgency on providing the expedite. And you'll also get a video that will help you prepare for the interview when it's time for you to go. The third option that we have and we're very proud of is we have a new course that is a do-it-yourself course and video to where we provide all our knowledge that we have on how to best navigate the expedited B1, B2 visa situation. So you'll get instructions on how to fill out the DS-160. instructions on the appointment portal, suggested language for asking for an expedite, and you still get an invitation letter from one of our sports-related consultancy groups that puts an extra set of eyes on the situation. And that is the visa course. So just to reiterate, right now it's probably too far out to get a regular B1, B2 visa interview if you're looking to attend the events coming up in cricket in the United States. So we have three processes that we are offering. One is an 01 work visa for persons that have the resources or highly talented or highly successful in business. The second one is We will be hands on with setting an expedited visa appointment on your behalf. And then third, you can take advantage of our success kit that includes all of our knowledge base for persons to empower themselves to apply for expedited servicing. from our knowledge base. Each of the visa options, whether it's us doing it or you purchasing the course, will allow you to get an invitation letter to the tournaments from our sports agency that helps push the application through since there is someone in the United States vouching that there is some skin in the game there. So I hope that you guys take advantage of these services and offerings from Innovative Immigration Law, also known as Shared Sports Visas. And we look forward to working with you and hopefully you'll be seeing these tournaments in the United States. Take care and be blessed.",,x,,,
"Mar.22, 2024",Payment Options with Innovative Immigration Law,Other Video,Payment Options with Innovative Immigration Law,Payment Options with Innovative Immigration Law.mp4,Payment Options with Innovative Immigration Law.mp3,"Hello, my name is Sherrod Seward, and I'm one of the intake attorneys here at Innovative Immigration Law, and I'm here discussing how the payment options work with our law firm. Typically, what we do is we do the legal fees up front, but we also give the option that you can pay for all of the fees, which is the legal fee along with the government processing fee which is usually expressed as either regular processing or premium processing, which includes the legal fee, the cost of regular processing, and the cost of premium processing, which are the government fees. And but you have the option to either pay the legal fees and then you can pay the filing fees when the case is ready to send or you can pay it all at once. Now, if you do the regular processing option, you always have the option of adding premium processing later if the adjudication time is not up to your liking. There are some other options out there if that's unfeasible for you. And there are two of them. One is we have a company we work with called Build Your Dreams Cash, which offers financing to persons seeking immigration services with our law firm. In that case, there's a link that you can go to and submit your information to see if you're a good candidate for them. A lot of times they do want someone or something in the united states they can use to sign off on on the uh transaction uh just so that they can be rest assured that they'll be able to recover in case there was a default um and if that's the case a lot of clients ask do we do that that is not something that ethically we could do we have to be outside of that relationship so you're Dealings with Build Your Dreams Cash is between you and them. We'll provide you the engagement letter that explains the fees associated with your petition, and then you'll work that out with them. They will pay the law firm on your behalf, and then you will pay them in the installments that you guys agree upon. The other thing that we do sometimes in certain circumstances that we do half of the legal fees do up front and then the rest of the fees do when the case is ready to go. A lot of times we don't really take a lot of time when it comes to finishing a visa application. So sometimes it doesn't make sense. but it is an option out there that you can pay half of the legal fee on your invoice and just indicate that you'll be paying the rest when the file is ready to be sent to USCIS and then also issue the filing fees for that. That's how payment works at this firm. Typically, it's the legal fees at first upfront, but you can pay for the filing fees at the same time if you just want to have it out the way. You have the resource of using Build Your Dreams Cash by going to www.owenpvisas.com backslash payments. We'll have an intake sheet for you there to start your relationship with them. And then in certain circumstances, you can request to have half of the legal fees paid up front and pay the other part of the legal fees when the case is ready to be sent to USCIS. I hope this message finds you in a great mood and we look forward to working with you. Thank you very much.",,,,,
"Mar.22, 2024",Message for US Masters T10 ,Business Development or Marketing,Message for US Masters T10 ,Message for US Masters T10 (1).mp4,Message for US Masters T10 (1).mp3,"Hello, how's it going? My name is Sherrod Seward, and I'm the managing member here at Innovative Immigration Law, also formerly known as Sherrod Sports Visas, where we're known worldwide, as maybe you know now, for doing immigration solutions in athletics, not only for the athletes themselves, but for executives associated with the sport and also support staff. Everyone that's involved with the organization, we're very adept and experienced at getting things done. And right now, I just wanted to address some things about last season and offer context for some solutions that we're doing for this season. So the last season, what we saw was that there were some inconsistent decisions at the USCIS level, and then there was denials at the consulate level after even there were visa approvals. Some of this is due to sometimes you just need more lead time. And then whenever you're introducing a new league organization right now to the adjudicating officers that oversee sports-related immigration, they're going to have differences of opinions on the new league. And now that we've gone through the first season, we have all that feedback there already. So in experience alone, we're very equipped to offer better responses and to also hold them more accountable for certain type of reasons. And one of the things we're doing as a firm, because we appreciate the business of the league owners and the league itself is that we have reduced pricing for addressing issues at the USCIS level when it comes to the visa filings. So you'll see from the league that there are different pricing that's just much lower for people that have already had a visa filed on their behalf from last season and did not get a good result. All right. The next thing is because the season has already gone on and we can now prove to USCIS that this is a robust league with some of the best players in the world and that a lot of people are watching. we now can have confidence in being able to file for P1 visas, which is not a good idea or something we could do last year. Just because since the league had not already been in action, it was known to us from previous experience that it faced a significant pushback from USCIS on whether the league required the participation of internationally recognized athletes. And it's for that reason that we went with the 01-02 factor, because it doesn't matter if the league needs internationally recognized athletes when you're using the 01 structure. Next is to address consulate issues. There's two things to go through them. One, when you're doing an 01 visa, the visas are dual intent, which means that the consulate officers cannot deny the visa entry admissibility. So you've already been approved for a visa, but now you're going to get the visa applied to your passport. Unlike most other non-immigrant visa categories, if you're approved for an O-1, it's dual intent, which means you can perfectly fine say to the consular officer that you do not plan to come back to your home country and you plan to immigrate, which is not something you can do on some of the other visa categories. So the best way to combat consular issues and not getting a visa stamped is to go for O-1 visas more than P-1s. What we have been working on for a couple of months now is we've been working directly with Senator Budd's office, who is a United States senator, with his congressional liaison that deals with immigration, to talk directly to the consulates that are likely to have athletes, coaches, and support staff come through to articulate how important it is to the impact of cricket on American culture and also to revenue for the state of North Carolina that these visas be given extra attention. So now we can go to that consular liaison, provide them with names and passports and appointment dates of new people coming in for the second season. And they will articulate to those consulates directly that these visas are important and the reasons why. And that will make it less likely just because the consular officers who have complete discretion, unless it's an O-1 visa, to Improve to approve those visas because they know that there's more skin in the game as somebody is watching and they definitely do not want to anger the constituents of the senators office. In addition, we offered to provide the league with more training and background of what to do at the visa consulate issues and how to present the information so to make sure that the best foot is put forward when the athlete support staff are going to the interviews in the first place. Okay. So now that we've addressed the inconsistent adjudications, we've addressed what we plan to do and are already doing with consulate issues for approving. The next thing I wanted to explain was the fee difference. So there has been an increase in the government fees that are associated with filing the visas, especially for premium processing. The actual pricing that we're doing for issuing visas on the legal fee side is actually less than what it was last year. But if the prices look more, it's just because the government fees are higher. Now, if the visas are initiated earlier, like in the next couple of weeks, What I suggest is doing it on regular processing and then seeing if they get approved or not. If they don't start getting approved by, let's say June or the middle of June, then premium processing can always be added to the visas later. However, of course, if there's premium processing added now, it gives us a lot more time to deal with any issues, especially if they do request for evidence or if there's problem at the consulate. But typically, we are able to get visa interviews if we're doing them pretty quickly. And we've offered that as a service as well to have us do the premium processing or, well, I'm sorry for the appointment processing in our expedite requests. But last year we were not doing the appointment setting and it was visa agents for the athletes themselves or individually. I'm not quite sure who was setting the appointments. But we have offered a reduced rate to actually be hands on with the consular processing. And if not, we're going to provide information, a step by step and a video that prepares people that are going for these interviews to put their best foot forward. So the league has the option there. We look forward to being of assistance to all the teams when we can do all the visas that gives us advantage because we know that everything is being submitted the same way and the same articulation of the robustness of the league is consistent and congruent, which leads to more consistent results. If you have any questions, please pass it to Asia. She'll pass it to me. And let's get this second season going off to a great start. Thank you very much and your attention to this video.",,,,,

This is Sherrod Seward at Innovative Immigration Law. Right now I'm going to discuss, honestly, one of my least favorite topics, which is consular processing. And it's not because it's important, it's just because it's one of those things where there's no rules. And so... When we're getting involved, like as an attorney, it's always just kind of like practice. And it's always different because we don't have the same type of tools we do where stuff is at USCIS, where there is more guidelines of what the USCIS adjudicating officers can and cannot do. At the consulate, it's pretty much a free for all. And even getting involved at all is never a straightforward thing. It's something where you're going to be at it for a while. And so while we do do constant processing and like we're very good at it, we're pretty selective about when we like to get involved at all. But that being said, I want to address some common issues about consular processing, especially in developing countries or countries where the consulates are tough because there might be a lot of immigrant intent that has occurred in the past, which has triggered a more aggressive policy from those consulate officers when it comes to doing visa interviews. All right. So the first thing I'm going to talk about is PIMS. Now, when you apply for a work visa, especially using Form I-. Which is common for the visas we do, which is P.O. one visas, things of that sort. When you check the consular processing box, the consulate that is notified in that box will get a copy or will get something sent to them from USCIS to the CBP consulate. Now, they might say that they didn't get that, and that might be because they are not as organized as they're supposed to be, or it's just some of the normal like consular BS stuff that they do to deny visas and buy time. um and maybe try to demoralize people trying to come and do their visa interviews so when that happens you know they'll give a paper to you that says hey come bring your petition your full petition to the consulate now at these visa interviews they do not have time to look at much of the paperwork anyway so having a full um A full petition package when you get to the consulate is not as helpful as you think, unless they have already decided that they're going to put the person in administrative processing, which then maybe they do get time to review the documents, but they send that back to DC for that to come back. And that's a longer process. I think maybe one of the more. I would say. Successful things are just practical things to do would be to email the consulate depending on which one it is with the documents. So at least they have it. And maybe there's more of a chance that will actually get reviewed, especially if it's a long document with hundreds of pages that they're just not going to look at anyway. But the real thing is when the consulate box is checked, they do get sent something with the package in original form from USCIS. Now, whether they choose to acknowledge that is their own thing. And the reasons for doing that is even more of a murky thing, unless they're looking to do devious things like deny visas. Now, the other thing that comes up is when there is discrepancies between like, you know, a lot of times petitions have things that are wrong or that is accurate as one would like, like, you know, missing eyes, dying teeth, stuff like that. That has no bearing on stuff at the consulate because that type of stuff, if it mattered, would result in a visa getting denied at the USCIS portion of the of the situation. So by the time it gets to the consulate, as long as the names are right on appointment dates, DS-Ds and forms, that's really all they're caring about. And if it's egregious enough, they'll be caught at USCIS and it's not a Customs and Border Patrol Department of State type of issue at that point. So to just relay, PIMS when connected on the box is sent, but some consulates are not very good or worse with acknowledging it. Coming to interviews with full petitions is practically not helpful because they don't have time to actually look at them unless they're going to put the person in administrative processing or if they're just being curious. And third, Issues with things that are adjudicated at USCIS level in general do not have any impact on the Department of State when it comes to the consular processing, as long as forms and appointment documents such as DS-DX-DX and appointment passport information line up. So I hope this is found to be helpful. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact our office. We have great consular processing lawyers here that do, as I mentioned, do consular work, but are very selective about it. So when you get a chance, just give us a call. Thank you very much.",,x,,,

Just waiting for the... There we go. For the Instagrams to go in live. This is myself, Sherrod Seward, sports immigration lawyer. I have a huge history in doing a lot of the visas for combat sports. Some previous clients include Canelo Alvarez, Tyson Fury, a lot of UFC champions. Speaking of that, a shout out to Ilya Tapuria. He is fighting for the UFC featherweight championship this Saturday. And we were able to get him going. Hey, Harry, how's it going? We were able to get Ilya's corner. Well, not his corner, but all his family members. So he had about nine family members that he wanted to get here in time for the United States to do the – to be here for his fight on Saturday. And we were able to get that done all on Visitor Visa's emergency appointments. Thank you, First Round Management, for the faith in me. I appreciate it very much. But right now, before I get into this, let me disclose that our firm did do the visa work for one Fighting Championships first event in the United States. It's something they planned for a long time and they took a lot of careful measures and they took their time with it. It was about a year and a half long project where they were gathering approvals and doing their planning for where they're going to do the events and they faced significant challenges. which I don't think people have a big enough appreciation for how big of a deal and how hard it is to do employment-based immigration in the United States, but also all over the world, especially in places where they might be more adverse to immigration, such as Japan, which is notoriously pretty tough to get work visas and especially immigrate to. So that's not a new concept. So yes, I did do work with one fighting championships for the first event, but I'm not currently involved in what's going on right now. So I don't have information directly with what's going on with Sage Northcutt and the the organization um what I will say is uh working with them I find them to be uh very uh professional and very um conservative to their approach not in a bad way but in a good way and um there's just a lot that can go wrong when you're dealing with uh visas all over the world and corners and stuff like that it just gets uh very complicated and One thing that's different between the UFC, well, actually, it's not all that different. The UFC does have an in-house team that does immigration and gets heavily involved in immigration outside of the United States. But it's not like they don't also contract with private attorney firms to help them get people in different countries. Like I know I've worked with a firm that does their visa work to Australia, but For anybody, forty-eight days can seem like a long time to get something done, and historically it is. And that's what Saif Nordstrom had said. He said, I turned all my paperwork in forty-eight days before the event. And I think he's talking about himself, his corners, and his coaches. But one thing I will say is it can be a different matter of saying I'm traveling with my coaches as opposed to I'm traveling with my corners. which means two different things. On one level, if somebody is traveling with you as your corner here in the United States, it's perfectly fine whether they're traveling on a visitor visa or if they're traveling on a work visa, because the UFC is not going to be paying them either way as corner people. You're just going to be the athlete that's paying them. But in different countries that can be different, which means if you say that you're coming to be a corner on the live broadcast screen, see like oh you're actually working for the organization you're not just coming as a as a visitor to just help your guy out and that's it and to which with that would require a work visa to do as opposed to if somebody was just coming like hey I'm his coach I'm not actually going to be on anything working I'm coming here just to support him help him do his weight cut I'm gonna get some tickets and then go into the stands And that is an easy miscommunication that could happen, especially when you're dealing with different countries, forty eight days and stuff like that. You know, the third party that they've gotten information might have said, oh, that's just a coach. That's not a person that's directly getting paid from the organization. No problem. Let them come in. And without a visa, they don't need to work and they can get there. Now, one of the thing is to say is the. the corners, the coaches that Sage Northcutt wanted to come actually did get into the country and were able to help with his preparations. What they weren't able to do was actually corner him in his fight. And when I'm thinking about this on the back end of how things like work out, It's easy to see how that slight communication miscommunication can happen to think that he doesn't need to work a visa. And one thing people need to know that it's never been harder. What are you talking about? The United States? We're talking about Japan or the European Union to get these work visas on. on especially on short notice basis. We've had plenty of cases that were straight up good cases that are hard to get nowadays just because of how aggressive everybody's being about employment based immigration. Here in the United States, it seems like the asylum humanitarian part of the business is going pretty well. But I can tell you from being in this business at the highest levels and at the lowest levels that it's never been harder to get these work visas for the fighters. And when you're dealing with different countries and time sets, forty eight days is not necessarily a long time. And it only takes one small communication issue for a third party attorney to not know the difference. If somebody is coming to be a coach of a person or somebody is going to be a corner of a person. That's why it pays to really work with attorneys that deal specifically in sports and in immigration so they know the nuance. Because that one cost them, I don't know if it's the main event or not, but Sage Northcutt was pretty upset. And it probably was something that's not that big of a problem to throw everybody on the bus. It's just probably that it wasn't communicated that the coaches are also corners. And in Japan, corners are considered people that need work visas, as opposed to coaches that fine but will not be seen anywhere near the broadcast but that's my take on this unfortunate um situation would like to know what you guys think um would like to know you know what do you think that it could have been done to make the communication better and um just your your your theory on kind of uh how this whole migration thing is going in general but yes again I've shared seward Sports immigration attorney to the United States. Previous work with top ranked Tyson Fury, Canelo Alvarez, a lot of UFC championships. Shout out first round management team, Ilya Toporia. Do your thing, boy. You're going to become a world champion on Saturday. I can feel it. I might be there. Let me go check the tickets. Let me go check the tickets. I might be at the fight. But anyway, hope you guys learned something from this. Communication goes a long way in dealing with somebody that knows not only the law, but the industry. That's important. That's big important. All right. So hope you got some value. I will see you guys later. Peace out.",,x,,,

Again, this is attorney Sherrod Seward with Innovative Immigration Law here with our ambassador of cricket, Asia. Please say hello to the people. Hello, how are you everyone? Nice to be here, Sherrod. Yep. As you guys probably know, cricket's on fire in the United States. And two thousand twenty four is probably going to be the biggest year in cricket history when it comes to the United States. We have three big tournaments, which is the ICC T-Twenty World Cup, the Major League Cricket second season and also the second season of my favorite T-Ten U.S. Masters League. And we're getting a lot of inquiries about people that want to come watch the tournaments. Let's talk about it. Yep. So as you said, right, it's cricket year, twenty twenty-four. World's biggest cricket tournament, ICC World Cup for T-twenty cricket is happening for the first time in U.S. People are going to fly from all over the world to United States to watch this. And they would need the most important thing is visa. And I think people are looking for a lot of help to make this case proper because Back in country, if you go and apply for visitor visa due to challenges, you want to be well prepared before you go. And it's a very valid reason to come to United States. Number two, Major League Cricket. Again, world famous players are playing in this league. So it's also a fan-loved tournament happening again in U.S. right after the World Cup. World Cup in June, MLC in July, and U.S. Masters T-Ten, world's fastest former cricket, is happening in August. So June, July, August, three months. It's back-to-back Super Cricket Festival in the United States. So really excited about it. Now, I went and took the liberty of looking at the current visa appointment times at countries where people like to travel for cricket to the United States, and it's not good. It's not good. You're looking at upwards of two hundred to three hundred and eighty seven days to wait for their visa appointments, which leaves us with certain avenues that we have to look at in order to get here in time to be here by June. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now, Asia and I have worked together on projects which feature the O-one visa, which you don't have to be an athlete to get. And I let her kind of like talk about her experience using the O-one and the timing mechanisms that come with using that visa category. Yep. So, yeah, I mean, Sherrod, as you said, right, last year we worked on US Masters T-ten. And Oban visa was one of the key visa. Again, there are a lot of benefits of doing Oban visa and you don't have to be athlete, as you rightly said, right? And it's open for if you qualify and we can share the qualification or you can visit our landing pages to understand if you sit and qualify. I think you're going to have some questionnaires as well to answer so that we can determine if a person is qualified to offer that visa. But I think it's fairly easy. quite a good option for many of the professionals back in various countries. Number one benefit, if I may take the liberty of saying the benefits, faster appointment time. So no need to wait until a year to get an appointment. As we know, tournament starts in June. And if you don't get visa until one year, you're going to miss the World Cup and all these great tournaments, right? So I think the faster appointment time, Pretty much negligible rejection rate because it's a dual intent visa. That's one of the, another benefit. Your dependents can come with you. Your spouse, your children can be here. Plus you can stay here if you want. It can easily convert you to even immigration EB-one green card. So it opens up a lot of doors of opportunity. And again, you are not bound to stay back in United States, right? You can still leverage this visa, come and enjoy the game. travel back and forth and take this opportunity. So I think, Sherrod, that's one of the magical visa, I would say, given that all the challenges we are facing back in a lot of countries right now. That's true. You only forgot one thing, which is no minimum investment, because a lot of people compare this to the EBITDA five, which you have to spend well over a million dollars, but there is no minimum investment for the O-one visa. Now, it might be a big investment to do just to watch a cricket tournament. But remember, it lasts for three years and you get all the work authorization you need as a business person to keep continue doing business in the United States. And cricket is not going to get any slower in the United States. Sherrod, how much was the approximate expense to get the O-One visa? All right, so your profit expense for entrepreneurs is around and this is where the prices are only going to go up as we get more popular, but it's going to be forty thousand dollars for the for the family and which is, you know, a lot better than using the EV five to where you're going to have to spend over, you know, a million and a half dollars to go get that done. And forty thousand is for family, right? Not just purpose. That's correct. We'll take care of everything in advance. uh well it depends how soon that you come in so right now for the first couple of clients that come in we're going to do a contingent where you can pay ten thousand dollars to get started for the whole family and then pay the rest when your visas are stamped nice some other people uh to come in and because it is such a new concept that's not done often with entrepreneurs really because there's not a lot of attorneys in the nation that just only do oh one visas that's pretty much all we do so we know uh so much about it but we want to spread the word and we want you to help us well I think this is really a good opportunity for a lot of people thinking about future plannings of course come in and enjoy the tournament Some family members may be about to come for education. So this is a perfect timing. Your family can come in and your kids can go ahead and go ahead in universities, complete their education. So again, you save all the headaches of going through F-one visa because again, F-one visa is also backed up by a year plus. So dates are not even available for FN visa. I think any of the families looking for their kids to potentially come to US for studies, I think this is one of the option they can opt for where entire family can come in instead of just the kid coming alone. That's true. That's true. You're allowed to do full-time study on O-three visas, which are the family versions of the O-ones, which are also pretty much privy to those same immigrant intent, dual intent. Because if you're coming and you have intent to stay, of course, your family would be as well. And the other thing to think about is depending on your background, we might be able to fit you into O-B instead of O-A, which will allow you to get essential support staff, which means people that work with you can obtain O-to essential support staff visas. And sometimes even extended family members are also privy to those support visas as well. It's an excellent program. Yeah, it is excellent. And I do see a lot of challenges these days with even the students who are here, parents getting capped out. Once they turn eighteen, students have to figure out some option to continue their studies. So just one question, Sherrod, more for the people watching us. If a student is studying on O three visa, can their visa be constantly renewed or can they convert because it's dual intent if their principal files for the green card? They automatically gets into the time. That's that's that's correct. So this is not like if you're doing a J-one visa or something like that, where there's like a two a two year. Yeah, you're absolutely able to adjust status off of the O-three visa with no problem since it comes in with that dual intent baked in. just as like the old one. So that's a great question to ask. Now, I guess the next thing we'd talk about is like, say, for example, you don't want to do the O-one visa to come for the cricket tournament, but you just want to do the visitor visas. We do have an option for that where we are really adept at getting emergency appointments on B-one. Matter of fact, there's a UFC fight that's happening as we're recording this on Saturday where we had to get B visa appointments for about nine family members. and was able to get that done in a week. So a lot of times it just depends on how stuff is prepared and what type of relationship you have with the consulate. But we have that available, too, for people that are, you know, they don't want to do the O-one visa investment but want to try the visitor visa. You can help your best case forward. OK, so basically where you can help build the right case for emergency visa appointment approval, right? Because it has to go through some reviews, which which is usually when you try to do yourself, you make mistakes and you get rejected. Rather use attorney to make, build your case correctly and request the appointment, right? Right. So there's like two things. So when we do the full service visitor appointment treatment, you also get an invitation letter from one of our petitioning services, usually SDS Sports Agency. And when you get a or, you know, it might be another agency that we work with, an invitation letter. Now there's somebody in the United States that has an invested interest in you getting here. And then also allow them to contact the consulate a different way as if you're just a foreign national. And if it comes down to it, you can actually go through your congressional office where the petitioner is to get some extra insight on that visa appointment, which sometimes can go a long way to pushing it through when they know that there's other people that have eyes on the situation. That's really helpful because I think that's kind of support and help that pretty much everybody would need if you're planning to come for your June World Cup, because the time is short, right? It's already February. So I really love the idea of having the services available, Sherrod. sounds good sounds good so everybody out there looking to come to icc world cup cricket uh ml major league major league cricket season and my favorite u.s t-ten masters You know where to come and to get your service with full service. Oh, once we're doing full service, uh, B visas, and we might even have some do it yourself kits. If you are bent on trying it yourself, we'll help you as best we can. Sure. Sure. And I would, I would second that idea. Please use our services because I think if you do it right, there are fair chances. not fair, I would say a lot of positive chances that you would be able to come down to U.S. and enjoy the game. At the same time, visit this beautiful country and enjoy your vacation as well, right? So don't miss out this opportunity. Absolutely. If you have questions, you know where to find us. It's not hard to do. Have a great day, everybody. Bye-bye.",,x,,,

This is Sherrod Seward, Global Investment Migration, actually Global Talent Migration. attorney where I specifically in my practice help people come to the United States on talent visas, but also we do investment in business visas, but we specialize in doing that with the O-one. And we also talk about the movement of people through talent visas throughout the world. And today I'm very excited to talk about how we help entrepreneurs with O-one visas as opposed to the EV-five with one of our partners that specializes in Southeast Asia. Asia Sheik is her name. And we're going to have a discussion on how we've already helped plenty of entrepreneurs get O-one visas to come to the United States and some of the nuances that might make this a better fit for our entrepreneurial clients. So I'm going to bring her in. How's it going? Can you hear me OK? Yeah, I can hear you. Hey, how are you? I'm doing great. It's a great day. Every time we're talking about solving problems on the global stage is a good day. Absolutely. Absolutely. And you have been really instrumental attorney firm that is helping a lot of people. And we have seen a lot of success. Right. So I'm really excited to be here. All right. So let's let's start with context. Let's talk about who you are, what you do and what you're interested in. Sure. So my name is Asia Shay, as you just got to know. I live in North Carolina, U.S., been here for about two decades now. And I work in IT industry. So I am an artificial intelligence director. I work for one of the Fortune hundred company and it's a global firm. So I deal with pretty much all kinds of people from across the country dealing with the talent that we have. And that's what I do. And on passion side, I have a deep interest in sports as well. So here I am. Right. You're kind of a jack of all trades, but I don't like to say that because you're so good at all of the things that you get into. And I'm always just impressed with your energy level when it comes to things. But one of the projects that we worked on together was the great tournament of the US T-Ten Masters League that was put on last summer and will happen again this summer. And I'll let you talk about the tournament and the partners involved and kind of how how was the experience last year? Sure. I'm sure you may not forget how we did that. Right. U.S. Masters season one was fantastic. getting planned across a few months. And then by the time we got all the approvals to land it up in US, it was very short period of time. I remember I called you very last moment and I'm like, Sherrod, I need your help. We need to get about four visas processed. And you were like, what? You need time to prepare for it. And I'm like, I have everything, but no time. Right. So, but it was great experience. I think you turned around and really helped our institution a lot. As we went through that, U.S. Masters T-Ten is the world's fastest cricket format. Ninety minutes and a game is done, right? So it's most loved, most energetic, adrenaline-rushed game growing very fast in U.S., Now with LA Olympics coming in, T-Ten is going to be the format that's going to get played in LA. So I think I'm really excited that we were able to launch it last year because that gives us good time of next four years to develop it further. Right. So, uh, that's how we landed up. US Masters season two is coming this August again. And, um, it was pretty successful last year. We had players from India, Pakistan, Australia, England. Bangladesh, so pretty much we had entire global MVPs and retired players who were playing in US Masters and it really turned out well. Right now. I don't know if I told you this story, When you called me, well, I happen to be in the office and I think it might have been the weekend, like a Saturday. I was definitely supposed to take a trip to New Orleans to go to Essence Fest and have a good time. But something told me like, hey, you need to be in the office, get things together. So I'm looking at, I'm just sitting on the internet and it's like somebody just called from Raleigh and they said they need forty visas. I'm just like, what? I need it like right now. And so I called and they're like, yeah, we need forty visas. Matter of fact, come to the draft. Now, I remember on the draft, I was actually on my way to Toronto to go to the Beyonce concert. I'm like, okay, I guess I'll stop in Raleigh and come. And I had a great time. I'm like, okay, this is real. Like, here we go. And we've been rocking. Sometimes things are destined to happen. And I think... me trying to reach out to get this visa, which is not so popular cricket like last year. Right. And you popping up as the top sports attorney firm really got in. And I was really amazed and thankful because if you wouldn't have done the visas, the tournament wouldn't have happened. Right. So it was it was very critical. And I think this is one thing where we can point out the power of the one visa for entrepreneurs, because this entire tournament was based on getting an O-B approval for the founder of the cricket league, which is very in the way for it to work. Because when you're doing regular sports events, so for example, something like the other major cricket league out there, you can do P-one visas because there's already established report of the international recognition of the tournament. But when you're doing something new for the first time, it's not likely that the P-one will work. So we have to find another avenue to do it. So what we did was we put the founder of the company under O-B. Why not O-A? Because if you do O-B, you can get essential support staff. Yep, absolutely. And I think when you gave me that suggestion, I went back to my team and said, guys, this is the game plan. Sherrod is very confident on this. Just let us do this paperwork. We got that. Our founder of T-Ten League, Mr. Mulk came up and We got his oven be done. And because of that, we got multiple players also on oven, right, which also really helped us to bring in their coaching staff, their support staff. And I think that whole bunch of planning and the strategy that you put in place. with all O and A, O and B, all those visas, right? Especially the entrepreneur visa. It's not very common, right? People may not be even aware about that, but that really opened the doors of opportunity for us. And that's how the league got successful. So really appreciate it. Thank you. And I think when most people think of business persons coming to the United States, especially from Southeast Asia, you usually think about the EB-Five program to where you invest usually upwards of nine hundred thousand dollars and typically end up spending by around fifteen. Well, like fifteen hundred thousand dollars, one million five hundred to really get the program going. And there's a couple of drawbacks, because even when you do that, you still have to wait a long time for you to become current. When you do the O-one, for one, what would you say the interview times were as far as like how long it took to get an interview once you have an approved O-one? It was right away. Like O-ones went, in comparison to other visas, O-one was pretty much like India, as we all know, right? For example, Indian embassies backed up like anything, right? But OVEN was pretty much available at a week's time. So I think that's also one of the biggest benefit you have is that the and you don't even have to land up for emergency appointments. It's like regularly OVEN appointments are easily available. So that was a big help. True. And the other thing is we have a big problem with non-immigrant visas in India and Southeast Asia. Some people getting denied for the officer saying immigrant intent and some other reasons. So do you mind speaking kind of like the issues that can happen when you're dealing with the non-immigrant visas at the consulate? Absolutely. So, yeah, I have got a lot of my family's friends and also a lot of our colleagues at work. trying to get that B-I, B-II visas or any kind of non-immigrant visa, it falls into that intent to immigrate kind of thing. And every time Indian embassy and some of the embassies across the world tend to reject visas a lot on this dual intent issue, right? They do feel that the population of this country pretty much goes to United States and with the intent of settling over there, right? But I think that's the biggest challenge. So despite you have a very strong reasoning, to go to US for a given work or personal reason, there is no pretty much opportunity to explain that to the visa officer. Many, many times it just gets rejected, right? And that's very frustrating because when you wait for a long time, the appointments are not easily available. Once you get an appointment, the rejection numbers are so high. That's the two biggest challenges that non-immigrant visas are facing. Versus O-one, You get the appointment right away. It's dual intent. So you don't have to worry about getting rejected on that reason that, okay, you are trying to go and settle out there. So I think that's pros and cons, straightforward benefit of going towards Owen, right? Right. So we're counting it. Big thing. Interviews. So one, you can get premium processing on the O-one visa, which means it can be done in days as far as like approval once it's submitted. Second, you can get an interview right away within a week, even in countries that have visitor visas that are backed up a year or more. Yeah. Three is dual intent, which means that you cannot be denied for immigrant intent. It's perfectly fine to say you are coming to the United States and you're never leaving, even though you don't have to stay in the United States. It's not like a green card where you have to be here. Keep coming. You can come in and out as you please. Children can come and study as long as they're under twenty one. You can get support staff and there's no minimum investment. That's a big thing as well, because when you compare with EB-Five, you'll end up with a lot of investment. Plus, you have to give promise of giving employment to X number of people for X number of years, depending on where you are trying to launch your business. O-One doesn't put you in all those clauses, right? So, of course, it weighs way more better option. And if you are qualified for that, definitely go for it. Right. And matter of fact, we're so confident in this program that one thing we've been talking collectively about is coming with a program where the first people that come and take advantage of that will do it at a certain type of business. What do you think? Do you think we should talk about it now or should we wait to let that one out of the bag? I think let one out of the bag. Let out the bag. So for I believe the first four new clients that we have off of this initiative right here. So if you're seeing this video and you want to take advantage of the O one A for for entrepreneurs, we're doing a special program to like where it's basically all almost all on contingency. So you can get started for you and your family for ten thousand dollars plus the filing fees. And we'll go take care of everything until the visas get stamped. And then we'll discuss the rest of the business after that. so we're so adamant and confident about this program that we just want to get more stories in the door so we can get more stories out the door and go tell more people about it that's true no and I I do also want to mention this right that um sherrod has a secret sauce to this uh he knows how to handle open visas and we have seen success right so I would surely recommend that if you have a plan uh do concert share it and team and I'm sure you'll get your results out so Right. And this is appropriate for people that want to immigrate to the United States because the old one is a great transition to the one a just merit based visa. But also you do not have to stay in the United States if you just want access. Say, for example, you really want to immigrate to Canada or somewhere else, but you want to do business in the United States, you can still have work authorization. in the united states while you live permanently somewhere else on the o-one visa it's really great um there too um so do you have um any closing thoughts on this one I think our next conversation will be able to do the the t-twenty yeah absolutely no I think I think this this wraps up really well um happy to answer uh questions if you guys come up with anything um please contact share it as I always say right you have the secret sauce so let's do more immigration programs More immigration programs. You guys have a great day. Thank you.",,x,,,

This is Sherrod Seward, managing member at Innovative Immigration Law, also known as Sherrod Sports Visas, where we do O-one, P-ones, E-B-one-A for the best athletes, entertainers, minds, and companies around the world. And right now we have a power hit top, one of the best, well, actually the best agent in MMA and now the NFL as well. and the agent of David and Joku. He locked them up for us. Let's go. Pro Bowl. Malky Cowell, let's bring him in. What's up, buddy? How you doing? Pro Bowl. I'm doing great. I forgot all about that. Yeah. He had a hell of a year this year, didn't he? He sure did. Turns out all we had to do was throw him the ball, you know? Amazing how that works, isn't it? All right. Especially, like, in motion. I think he does really well when he gets it. Like, they're running the short routes and turning around and giving it to him. It's like, well, you know, he weighs sort of sixty pounds. He's not, like, a little guy that can shift like he's, you know, Tyreek Hill. So, I think we got him moving in motion, which helped his yak. And, boy, we needed that. It really did. They had a really good year this year. Hopefully, next year they can, you know, they can build on that and do better. You know what I mean? Right. So... I'm going to set it up for the people that don't know because I'm going to put this on the LinkedIn where they have a lot of techies out there. They might not know about sports as much. But Malky came up in the real estate game and then he got into Mixed martial arts management where he's- Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. I actually came up in the real estate game and became a football agent first. Everybody always says I'm an MMA agent. That became football and that's not true. I actually got certified in the NFL and started working in MMA in two thousand eight. It's just that the clients I represented In MMA, we're really, really big clients, multiple champions. So everybody looked at it like it was an MMA agency and not the truth, which is a multi-sport, multi-faceted agency. But, you know, it's all good. But I think that's nuanced because, you know, dealing with the CBA and the nuances in football, I imagine there's a lot more moving components and just a lot of people to deal with and rules than there were in MMA. So do you think by dealing with football first, It helped you think outside the box of everybody else when you came into doing MMA. Yeah, because MMA was very much the Wild Wild West and the NFL having a union makes it very, very structured. So just from the perspective of an agent, I'm the first one to come in there with a contract that was open ended to where you could terminate at any time. A lot of guys were locked into these contracts that had them signed to guys for five and ten years. So because of my experience in the NFL, that's not how it is. I came in and told guys, look, this is what I got. You know, the best fighter in the world signed. Right. I'll do you first. Because NFL players on I'd come to the best in the MMA to say this is what these guys got. Basketball, MMA, baseball is all the same. You can fire me anytime you want, but you still have to pay me for what I do. So if I do your contract, you got to pay me. And guys love that because if they didn't want to be with us for whatever reason, they can get up and go. Most guys I have still to this day have had their whole entire careers and they basically are on a deal where they can leave anytime they want. So from the evaluating talent side, did you do that yourself or did you have somebody to tell you who's a beast and who's not? Well, no. So it depends. In MMA, you know, there's a bunch, I have a bunch of guys that work with me. When I first started, it was just me and I would just dove into fights and I'd watch them all the time. I'd watch guys. I remember watching Jon Jones and knowing he was going to be the best. Like I can evaluate fight talent really well. Football, my relationships with guys in the NFL, I just ask the scouts. They'll tell you who's who and who's not. It's not what you see with Mel Kiper. It's not what you guys think you see on TV. Just because a guy rushes for a lot of yards, that's not how it works. In the NFL, you've got to have to talk to the guys who are making the decisions to determine whether or not the guy that you're looking at is actually a draftable prospect. Got you. Now, do you have a preference when it comes to dealing with to guys that are moving on to their second contract? Repeat that one more time. You came in and out. Say it again. I know some agents that prepare, they prefer to deal with guys that are coming on their second contract and do not pay as much attention to the draftees. But for you, is it kind of like both? Do you have one that you enjoy better? A client is a client. Whether they're coming into their rookie year or they're coming into a second contract, you want to listen. It's like having kids, right? You love all your kids the same, but you pay attention to the one that needs you the most that day. At the end of the day, that's kind of how I look at this. So whether you're going into a second contract or you're a rookie, it's my job. You know what I mean? So I pay attention to both the same. Now, if you're asking me preference... know there's something fun about taking a guy right out of college through the process getting them drafted being there on draft day watching their emotions pour out the natural raw emotion of finally making a dream come true I think that's amazing from a cost perspective guys on the second contract you know you meet them you sign them you get a second deal there's no there's no uh it's not the same you know what I mean there's the emotional aspect of it isn't there like that somewhat kind of because you know they get a big contract it's it's you know it's overwhelming but You don't have to spend the money you spend on a rookie. Does that make sense? So if I didn't have to spend money and I could just make money, if it was just my bottom line, then, yeah, you'd rather do it that way. But I actually enjoy the whole rookie process. Yeah. That's got to bring me to another thing. I just thought about this strategically. If you have unsigned free agents, they can get to their second contract quicker than the drafted athletes. Well, you know, the undrafted free agent is not, you know, typically going to make it to a second contract, if that makes sense, right? Like, that's not the way that works. If they were that good, they would get drafted. There's guys that make it, but that's not necessarily the route you want to go as an agent. But I get guys undrafted first round, in the middle, all over the place, so it doesn't really matter, if that makes sense. But what if they're foreign agents? And nobody knows they exist, but they're like monsters. Yeah. Who could do that? It would be a major advantage for somebody to have the ability to find guys that nobody can get their hands on. Right. And that's why I kind of strategic. Because we're supposed to be talking about global migration. Yeah. But you broke my imagination. I thought you were MMA into NFL. So when you said NFL to MMA. Yeah. Most people don't get that part right. And I don't know why. I've said it since day one. I actually first got licensed as a football agent in two thousand five and did MMA from that point forward. So do you have that in your bio? I did. It's been there forever, but I don't know if anybody reads bios. I try to do my research. So. The reason I brought up, like I was talking about before we had this, is Malky on the MMA side, and a lot of the more sophisticated managers get this, there's a lot of advantages to getting visas for fighters through the agency. For one, a lot of times promotions can put undue pressure on fighters when they have the visa and tell them when to fight, when they're going to renew and all that. And also it kind of takes away their ability to negotiate if they have to wait on work authorization for somebody else. So what I was kicking around with Malky was, and we were talking about NIL deals too, to where college students can't get paid on visas, but they could get paid on work visas. So we're looking at the idea of taking the same visa structure we do in MMA, which is first round management will hold the visa to do that also in football, because a lot of these foreign players end up on short term, you know, training camp visas and you can't, And if they get cut, they have to go. You can't train to be a football player in Cambodia, right? Right. I mean, listen, there's definitely an advantage to doing that. And obviously, there's a bigger advantage to having attorneys like yourself accessible that understand it and that know it. If anybody's watching this podcast, okay, I can tell you that we've been dealing with your friend. I can tell you, to the listeners, right, to the viewers, that I've been dealing with him. I should go the other way. That way, yeah. My screen is that way. I've been dealing with him now for, has it been over ten years already? Yeah, I think so. Okay, at least ten years. He's the only guy I go to to any visa issue. He's the only guy that I would trust to handle any visa issue. Matter of fact, it got to the point that he's so good at it, I introduced him to the UFC, and they started using him for their complicated cases and things that they needed to get expedited. He's the guy. So, listen, whether you're an agent that's listening to this or you're an athlete, whether it's a fighter or a football player, The one thing you definitely want is to have an agency that's looking at the big picture and not just, hey, I got you, you know, the NFL got you the visa. Let's go over there. And then you go in there and then you get cut. And then now you're back to whatever home country you came from and you need to stay. So your agent should be willing to get you the visa and put it under their banner so that way you can stay in the country and then go from there. And I think that's kind of like, you know, when we sat and talked about this and you explained all the outcomes that people have, you know, it made a lot of sense for us to do it the way we do it. Yeah. And I think I appreciate that also. And I think the longevity comes with looking at longevity from the beginning. It's all about infrastructure. whether it be visa infrastructure, relationship infrastructure, and just attention infrastructure, like you said. Hey, it don't matter if the contract's open-ended if they're dealing with us. Correct. But it is. I mean, listen, here's the thing, though, right? Like the concepts are very simple. If you were in a relationship, right, you didn't want to be in it. Do you really want a contract that made you stay in it? You'd want to get out of it. Right. And listen, somebody can kick, cry and scream all day long. They can promise to change, promise to do this, promise to do that. It's your choice to stay or go in these contracts. If I sign you to a five-year deal, I can do whatever I want. I got you in a five-year deal. As long as I do my end, you know, offer you fights, get you fights, do this, do that, you can't go anywhere. And that's not the right thing to do. I think if somebody does not want to be with you, they shouldn't be with you. So to me, it was like, look, it's either I do my job and people stay or I don't. And they go. Sometimes they go for ridiculous reasons. Sometimes I deserved it. It is what it is. But that's kind of the reality of the life. I think this is the way it's supposed to be done, in my opinion. I could be wrong, but for me, I've had a very successful business doing it that same way. I know all the big sports do it that way. boxing and mma are the only ones where the contracts are long and you know what I mean that you're owned by the agency or the promoter or whatever it be and I've just done I don't agree with that yeah yeah I mean I can relate um I remember um I mean I can talk about now but uh I'm from ohio and I went to law school in cleveland where I got introduced to mma through naafs which was um you know had a certain promoter that ended up uh managing um steve pay my osic and for a little bit and stuff like that. And then I remember Stipe got a contract. He fought a couple of times. And the next thing I know, I'm getting told he has an eight fight contract. And I'm just like, he has a what? Yeah, but those were standards in the UFC at that time, though. Especially if you were looking for angling for more money or something to that effect. You ended up getting stuff like that. You know what I mean? It's just, you know. But the thing about the UFC, though, I got to give them a lot of credit. An eight-fight contract never always ended up being eight fights. With John's deals... We had eight and ten fight contracts, and they would get me done three fights in, two fights in, four fights in. It just depended on where we were at money-wise and who we were fighting and what the deals were going to be or what they looked like. And it always worked out. I always, you know, had tough negotiations with the UFC, but I always felt like they treated us in a certain way that was fair in a lot of ways. And it really, you know, you could say it's unfair, and maybe in some cases it might have been, but, you know, it was always really unfair. It was fair to just be on his face. Being locked in for that amount of, because, I mean, eight fights is. Yeah, but you got to understand, too, Sheridan, like a lot of boxers, when you look at the boxing model, they get these fights and they build up, they get built up, right? Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen wins, and then they go fight somebody for real. The reality of it is, is that if you really believe that you're that good, right, and you think that you can promote yourself, why even sign to the UFC? Yeah. You get where I'm coming from? Like, you look at it on the other side of the thing. They're the ones with the platform. They're the ones with the outlay. They're the ones who are promoting the fight. Now, I'm not... Listen, I'm not championing for them. I'm not sitting here saying that they're right and fighters are wrong because I'm never going to say that. But the reality of it is you need to... parts for this thing to work. You need the fighters more than anything, and you need the promotion with the platform. And they built this business from scratch. And a guy who's five and five, I'm sorry, five and two, six and one, seven and three, can still go on to be a multimillionaire in MMA. I don't know many boxers who are not on the field getting title shots. I don't know many boxers who aren't twenty-something and oh, nineteen and one, twenty-three and two, something to that effect. that are getting title shots, right? In MMA, you can be seven and oh and get a title shot. You can be three and six and get a title shot. You can still make pay-per-view and make money. So is the model perfect? No. Is it better than boxing? In some cases, yes. In some cases, no. But, you know, I'm just telling you that an eight-fight contract, for me, signified that in three or four fights, we'd get it done. And we always did. You get where I'm coming from now. If it's the idea of not going to free agency, the reality of it is, bro, a lot of guys, there wasn't a lot of options back then. You know what I mean? If you were making three, four million dollars in the UFC, Bellator wasn't offering that. Bellator wasn't matching that. You had to really be something special for them to do that. So if you had a guy that some people, you know what I mean? Some people can, what do you call it? It would be all right. You know what I mean? So. I'll bring you two questions. You got time for two questions? Yes, sir. Two tough questions. So I'll give them to both. Well, let's go with the first one. So Bellator, off the show time. From what I understand, they're not operating in the United States right now to focus on Europe. Are you surprised by that? What do you think? What do you think about that? No, listen, that's the PFL. Bellator is not owned by the PFL. So if they're operating in Europe, it's because they're building up the European series and the Challenger series themselves. they have out there in in europe but uh I'm correct they're gonna be doing shows in the in the u.s but I could be wrong I mean if that's what they're doing then you know that they must have some sort of business strategy in europe and in the middle east and all that that you know I'm just not aware of at this moment okay so they were purchased by pfl correct who has espn deal um right here and um How's the PFL doing in your opinion? Is it a profitable business yet, or is it something we're still in the investment phase? We don't have an idea. I know that Saudi's just invested a whole bunch of money, and from what I know, they're doing good. Other than that, I have no idea. I'm not an investor. I'm not a shareholder. I don't get reports. I have no idea. I'm the wrong guy to ask. Got you. Sometimes at UFC, you can go and see a report on what their revenue deal with you at ESPN was, but I've never seen a revenue deal on it. what it looks like with uh pfl so listen they put on fights the checks cash the fighters are happy everybody's good so they're good with me I like the pfl they're good people and I think they're going to be all right so I listen I want everybody to be okay I like everybody to be okay to be honest with you I like that they seem to be um very like uh they're pliable You know, I saw that Francis, that's my next question going about Francis, but I saw Francis sign with them, and then we did business with Facility Promotions, and I went to their shows when Clarissa Shields was fighting. Oh, man, we were so scared. Like, Clarissa Shields, I like her because she don't compete with anybody. She just wants to fight. She don't care what it is. Right. I thought that was the first time. I'm like, you know what, your lesson is different out here. It's different. But, you know, to the PFL, that they were willing to do that deal. Now, here's my next question is, I remember a couple years ago, it was about a good five years ago, and I was sitting across the table from Francis Ngannou, and he says, I want to fight Tyson Fury. And I said, no you don't. I didn't even mean to say it. He looked at me like he was getting ready to kill me. But he went out and he set his deal out with the UFC, and then now he's kind of doing his things with Saudi Arabia. And when you said, if you can promote yourself, what is the benefit of, you know, having a promoter. But I just want to kind of get your, like, you know, your thoughts on that model where he really kind of, like, bet on himself. He did bet on himself, but that's different. What I said was, what I said was, if you really like that, then go promote yourself. But I'm talking about from the ground up. He's who he is because he was the UFC champion. If they never put him on the stage, up until he fought in the UFC, you never heard of Francis Nagano. He was a kickboxer before that, correct? You never heard of him. No one ever knew anything about him. So if we're being honest, what I'm saying, what I mean by what I said was you can't be the guy that says, you know, I'm coming here. I'm going to be brought up by you guys, promoted by you guys, put on the biggest stage by you guys, paid by you guys, and then turn around and pretend that I did all that by myself. One thousand percent. He did the right thing. Listen, he did the right thing. He fought his contract out. He sat it out. He did everything that was within the rules of his contract. He went on to something that he deems to be better, bigger and better. How can anybody be mad at that? I mean, listen, Dana's going to be upset and people are going to be mad, but he did what he did. You know what I'm saying? And God bless him. But to pretend that he got what he got. Because it was just him. You can't convince me of that. Because before the UFC, I got guys that make a lot more money than boxers in fighting. Listen, they might be, you know, seventeen and six in MMA, right? Former world champ or whatever. Goes to boxing in his first fight. He's making five hundred grand in boxing. Nobody in boxing makes five hundred grand in their first fight. You know what I'm saying? Six fifty for this one, three fifty for that. They don't make that. For you to make that type of money, you got to be fighting for a belt most of the time. Regional belts and stuff like that. You get what I'm saying? The fact that he did what he did, God bless him because what he did do, let me tell you what he did. What he did was he did not resign. That's it. If there was no PFL, and by the way, If there was no PFL, right, maybe he still, you know, signs. Because he signed a boxing deal as well. Oh, we might have lost him. Hold on. Can you see me? Sorry about that. I got a phone call at the same time. He signed a boxing deal. And what I'm saying is that without boxing, without MMA, I don't know that he would have signed that boxing deal. He doesn't like Tyson Fury. And he's a very big star today because of everything that he's done. And kudos to him for doing it. I mean, it is what it is. Did you see that fight? Did you see the fight with him? Can you hear me? I can't hear you. Okay. I'm going to have you on mute. Hello? Yeah, can you hear me? Can you hear me? I can hear you, yes. I can't hear you. Oh, man, we lost him. I don't know why. It's all right. We can wrap it up. We can wrap it up. It's okay. I can't hear you. I'll give a text. It looked like we had some technical difficulties, but overall I think it was a great conversation. Let me see if there's something else here. Hello, hello? I don't know how to fix it. No, it's okay. We'll wrap it up. All right. I don't know what that means, but thank you for having me on the show. Thank you for having me on the show. I'm sorry. I don't know why I can't hear you, but, um, You know, let me reiterate that the work you do is awesome because you give a lot of people opportunity to come to the U.S. to be in these promotions, the NFL. I think you're the only guy that ever got a guy internationally into the NFL, you know, which I thought was an amazing move on your part. And if anybody's watching this podcast, I can tell you guys hundreds and hundreds of athletes. His firm has handled and done a phenomenal job. There's been very few rejections, very few, unless there was some sort of ban coming from overseas or the State Department said, hey, no XYZ. And even then, he still got a lot of stuff done that others couldn't do. So he's the man. I just wanted to tell you that. Can't hear you. I don't know if the listeners can, but I'm off on that note. Take care, my bro. God bless you. And if there's anything you guys need, let me know. Thank you. Let's get it.",,x,,,

This is Sherrod Seward with Innovative Immigration Law. One of the head attorneys here will be specializing in O-I, P-I, and EB-I-A visas for the best athletes, entertainers, entrepreneurs in the world. But today we're talking about an important industry of journalism. And we unfortunately experienced a denial that we consider unfair. And we are going to fight back, not just for this particular case, but to highlight in general some of the issues that are plaguing the foreign press when it comes to obtaining visas to come and cover issues in the United States. So at this time, I'm going to bring in one of our great clients, Tanya Cashaw, who is a freelance independent journalist to kind of talk about her case. And we're going to talk about the steps we're going to take forward to address this issue for her, of course, but also for the industry of freelance journalism in general. Let's bring her in. Hello, Tanya. How's it going? Good. How are you? I'm doing very good. One, I'd like to tell you that we appreciate your patience with this process and also apologize to the unfair treatment you're getting from USCIS along with some of your colleagues. So I just want to open the floor to kind of let you talk about what you've seen so far from yourself and also some of your colleagues in the industry. Yeah. So all in all, it's been a very tough time for the industry. As we know, they're having a lot of layoffs. But apart from that, the immigrant journalists or even foreign journalists who want to come to the US have been essentially ostracized in a way. So there was a story of a Hungarian journalist who wanted to come here and he was under the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to come here on like, in a way diplomatic status and speak to the Hungarian diaspora here, but his visa was denied. Even though he had a very clear indication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to come here. And he's just a sports journalist. So his press was deemed undesirable. Apart from that, There have been threats against a lot of journalists, immigrant journalists. A journalist in the US who is undocumented was threatened on live TV that we're going to call ICE on you. We should have gotten you deported. So that kind of language is resurfacing and it's especially worrying with the election coming up because we need journalists in this country, especially immigrant journalists, to report on the important issues that are with the various diasporas. It doesn't have to be political. can be sports, it can be healthcare. And that is so, so important that it has almost become a matter of press freedom in the US. And we have seen even apart from immigrant journalists that press freedom is under attack in the US. Right. And I guess Even before we kind of get into the nitty gritty of what's happening in your particular situation, I want to back up and kind of talk about the visa options that are available to journalists. So if you're a journalist by yourself and you want to come to the United States and cover an event, you're probably looking at a visitor visa because you don't need work authorization if you're not getting paid here. The next one that you look at is an I visa, which is specifically for press to come with work authorization to cover a certain event. And then the one that we specialize in is the O-one visa. And there's a strategic reason why we like this, because under the visitor visa and the I visa, you don't have what's called dual intent, which means that the consulates have a lot of leeway to deny those visas saying, hey, we don't really think they're going to come back to your home country. There's no petitioner that's in the way that can go and do a congressional inquiry to say like, hey, there's somebody here interested in the United States that's on this. And then the dual Intent concept means even if you do intend to come to the United States and stay forever, you can do that on an O-one visa because it's reserved for the best people in that industry. And that's the type of visa that we went for for Tanya or the O-one B category, which we have done a lot of these and find her to be very qualified for it. And I'll let you kind of like kind of speak to that about like this. Let's give your experience. Let's talk about you for a second so they can understand what you're bringing to the table. Let's not be modest here. Yeah, for sure. So I am an international journalist. I have been I have worked in India. I worked in the UK. I have worked in the US. So I have a lot of experience. I've been working as a journalist since twenty seventeen. I was I actually did my master's at Columbia Journalism School, one of the world's best journalism schools in the world. And I was awarded by them two monetary awards for my work. Apart from that, I was the only data reporter at Yale Finance because I am a multimedia journalist. So I have all the skills apart from just writing, which is audio, video, data, computational, like I can code and stuff. So those things are very rare to find in a journalist. So I have, apart from Yahoo Finance, I've also done, of course, a lot of freelance work on the side where I have covered societal issues, homophobia, racism, and a whole lot of other things. So yeah, and I actually applied with Sherrod and his team for the O-B visa. So when we first applied, I think it was in August, went under premium and they took a lot of time to even acknowledge that it was under premium. They took one month to do that. And by September, when they acknowledged it, fifteen days later, they said, okay, we need more evidence. And they were very vague about it and said, they didn't specify what kind of evidence they wanted. They wanted evidence of basically everything, extraordinary ability. So we sent all additional evidence, whatever we could find, including peer review and a whole lot of other things. And then, fifteen days later, there was a denial, like just before Christmas. It's really out here ruining my Christmas. I think you brought up two great points there, nuances. One is, There was a lot of problems with USCIS that are not fixed yet with them acknowledging filings properly. We're seeing rejections for filings for no reason at all. And at the time that you were filing, I think we filed in the California Service Center, not too long after that, magically I look on the website and it says, now send it to Texas. And there was no kind of indication of why, when this was happening. So I imagine during this transition of sending all these files to Texas that a lot of stuff has gone wrong. You know, one of those was just, you know, just like that. And then also, I think when it has that type of chaos, the adjudicating officers do not have the time to properly look at cases the first time. So much so that we were strategically considering not putting as much evidence as we could into the first filings, anticipating that they're going to give a request for evidence anyway, no matter what you put in it. And think about it. If you put all the evidence that you can into the first petition and they send a request for evidence, you don't have anything else to send them. now you're stuck. And it could all be because they didn't have time to look at the evidence anyway. It's easy to say, you have not met the criterion because it's all subjective. But that's why I think when it comes to situations like this, especially with O visas and EB-A, litigation might be the best place to go because all the category eligibilities are subjective. So I like to say, let's get a referee and let's really find out what's going on. Yes, definitely. They have been very like causing a lot of stress to a lot of people. And I'm sure I was not the only one because some of my friends who have also applied for the O-B and are journalists and a lot of times who people who didn't even apply for premium face similar situations where any of that they were met with a lot of vague language. They're met with long delays for, and just generally not a lot of acknowledgement on USCIS side. I'm hoping that the litigation would help with all this. Right. So the reason why we like litigation, just kind of talk strategically how it works is if you get a visa denied, there's really two general options that immigration attorneys will do. One is just to refile the case and the other is to appeal the case. The problem with both is that both of those go directly right back to where you had the issue in the first place without any type of third party oversight to see if something will become different. So when you do the litigation, and we're doing this the best way we like to, is we go ahead and file a new case and include information that we didn't have in the first one for two reasons. For one is you get that chance that the new one can be approved naturally, but also you get a second piece of information to argue if negotiate with USCIS during the litigation. Because what will happen is their attorney will contact you and maybe say like, hey, if we approve either one of these cases, can you go ahead and dismiss the case, which is usually what happens most times in employment-based immigration litigation. To which we would say, probably yes, unless we want to get really gangster with it and set a precedent. But I don't think we want to do that this time. And I don't think they really want to do that either. Because if they do take it to court, then it starts setting precedent. which they have to go follow, right? And so they are inclined to not want to set that precedent, especially when you have well-articulated cases that can get into the press and then, you know, they start not looking so good, you know? And then it can become cases that they have to follow. So that's why we like it when the clients see and have the courage to go ahead and pursue the litigation because you get quicker results. And we also get somebody else's eyes on the situation that takes it out of the hands of just USCIS. Yeah, that is true. And I think that is very important in case of journalists, especially because if a journalist is not working, there are a lot of stories that go completely under the radar and we'll never know what's happening. A lot of major pieces, including some Pulitzer Prize-winning pieces, have been reported on by immigrant journalists in the US. So even undocumented immigrant journalists here, especially the one who was threatened on live TV. If journalists are being put in a situation like this, there is, in a broader sense, democracy is kind of under attack because journalists essentially give us all the information that we need. Um, so it's, it's to say that like, and seeing this situation where not only me, but a bunch of journalists, um, by the immigration department are, um, I don't want to say like attack, but like put through a lot of, um, hurdles and bureaucracy that prevents them from working, um, or delays their work. Um, is a very concerning matter because it not only affects the journalism industry, but also affects society as a whole. Yes, I think that's a great point to just look at it, not at this particular case, but just how it affects the whole system of free press and coverage for the world to know about the world's events. So what I think we'll do is we'll wrap and let you know that there'll be a press release going out about this litigation. And it's something that we're going to be adamant about getting the word out. Just so the more people that have eyes on it, the more people that care, and the better that is for the fairness of this whole process. So Tanya, I'd like to thank you for your patience. Again, apologize for what you experienced, but we're going to do something about it. Thank you. All right. Talk to you soon. It is.",,x,,,

Come on in. I want to see if we can work on getting the Instagram to go live. Here we go. So I'm just going to bring in Instagram and then we're going to get it going. So this Saturday, if you're in the combat sports world, you already know that there's a main event in California, Anaheim. for the featherweight championship of the world. It's going to be Volkanovski from New Zealand training an Australian fighting. Actually, that might be the other way around. I'm not sure. I think he's Australian training in New Zealand. It's going to be fighting one of my favorite fighters of all time, Ilya Tapuria, who I've had the pleasure with working for and with on the immigration side for almost maybe four years now since he's been in the UFC, actually went to his UFC debut in London a few years back. But I want to kind of just use this opportunity to talk about problem solving when it comes to doing immigration in the entertainment space, because a lot of times you're asked to do things quickly. And yeah, let's just say you're asked to do things quickly and it's really all about results and the stakes are high. You know, take it if you were going to have the biggest fight of your life, you definitely want to have your family members there by your side to to enjoy it with you. So the way that it works with the ultimate fighting championships is that they'll get the visas for the fighter. and for their cornermen that they specify. And usually those cornermen will get B-one visas. They don't get work visas to come. In Ilya Tepory's case, he actually has a visa that's placed with his management company, which is First Round Management out of Miami, Florida and all around the world. And they're probably the biggest managers of mixed martial artists in the world. So they understand the nuances and the significance of being able to obtain your own visa. as opposed to wait for others to get it. So he's on his own P-one visa that is tied to his agent, as opposed to the traditional way when your visa is tied to your promoter. And one thing that can happen when your visa is tied to promoter is you can get pressure put onto you to maybe compete sometimes when you don't want to, because you're worried about whether your visa will get renewed and things like that. I'll probably cover it in another video to talk about a lot of the issues that are facing independent fighters from getting their own visas and other sports too. We just had some unfortunate news for an NFL player that had a visa that was connected to his agency where USCIS is giving a lot of pushback. It just seems that there's a lot of pressure from the larger organizations to prevent individuals from getting visas pretty much for themselves to do as they wish. But we'll keep fighting the fight there. But this particular situation was Ilya had the fight coming up and it was probably in the fights in February. And we probably got the notification to go ahead and try to bring his family members. And there's nine of seven, eight of them in to the fight. So the first thing you look at is the timing issue. The obvious thing you would look to see is if the country that the people are in are eligible for ESTA visa waivers. He is from Georgia, so his people are from Georgia, and unfortunately, that's not one of the countries that enjoy the benefits of the ESTA Visa Waiver Program. If you do not know, if you're in certain countries such as England, you can come into the United States on a waiver of having a visa. I mean, you can just kind of apply for ESTA. It comes usually back in about an hour or two. go to the airport and fly in and it's usually good for sixty to ninety days. But if you're not in one of those countries, then you have to get a visa. The second thing we look to see is the visitor visa. What are the current wait times on obtaining an interview to get a visitor visa? and are any of the individuals eligible for the waiver of an interview. If you can waive your interview, then you don't have to actually go and schedule an appointment. It's just a case that you'll send your passport to the consulate along with some reporting documents and they'll send your passport back to you. Unfortunately, none of that applied in this circumstance. So we had to do two things. And this is like the full service type of thing we'll do in this situation, especially when it's such as high stakes as a world championship with the greatest organization in the sport. What we do first is we set visitor appointments for everybody individually. next what we do is we try to expedite those visitor appointments in this case when we set these appointments they were probably six to nine months out from when he needed them needed them to be so as a backup what we do is we file for p-one s essential support staff visas and when you're fighting for a world championship it's not just about the competition there's a lot of momentum that has to be harnessed in order to maximize the opportunity monetarily, whether that be from sponsorship perspective, community development perspective, or just even a branding perspective. There's a lot of hands and minds that come together to make a full team on the competition and on the business side come to fruition. So we look at the background. and the traditional support that everybody in the family have given to Ilya on his journey here. And we use that to craft a single petition that has every person on there, their job titles, their roles, and what they'll be doing to support him in his championship fight on the P-one S visa, which is a work visa. And the other reason we do that is because the work visas will have earlier appointment dates than the visitor visa. So in this case, in Jordan, the I mean, in Georgia, the visitor visa appointment dates were six to nine months out, but the P visa appointments were only about a week. Now, The problem is once you send these visas in, you have to wait for them to be processed. So you use premium processing, and we stuffed everything we could in the petition to try to avoid a request for evidence. But the way that things work now on the employment-based immigration side of USCIS is that you can expect a lot of RFEs, especially when there's a lot of beneficiaries, because we can put all those people onto a single immigration petition. And so, unfortunately, we got to eat RFP there, which kind of messed up the timing there. But fortunately, we were we were able to get emergency visitor visa appointments booked for every single beneficiary. And I definitely want to send a thank you to the UFC, who was. very responsive to the staff and gave us a little bit of information we needed to push this over the hump. And thank you to the consulate in Georgia that was very accommodating and getting these emergency appointments one booked and then approving them right away. So we're glad to support Ilya to your Puria and his world championship exploits. And we expect him to win because he's a he's a hell of a fighter and he's a hell of a guy. And so we're glad to be on his team and good luck and congrats to all of his family members that are now on their way to the United States. You have any questions? You know where to find us. We're not hard to find. So thank you for tuning in and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you very much.",,x,,,

Looking to get this one started. I'm just working on getting Instagram on the fold. And here we go. We're ready. I think a lot of people know that there is an executive order out there put out by the Biden administration to bring the world's best minds in artificial intelligence and also STEM to the United States. And I think it's a great idea, but we've been doing a lot of research in the market for a couple of reasons. One is we're adamant about being the best immigration law firm in the United States for the O-one A, O-one B, and EB two with the national interest waiver applications for AI professionals in the nation. And then also we have products that we're making on our own with some of the AI talent that we have access to to bring products to the market to help lives easier for immigration lawyers and then probably for even people to do visa petitions themselves. But While going through and navigating this space, I've noticed that there's a big gap and maybe a misunderstanding of how AI talent is applied in the market. So what we find is that there's usually either the large companies looking for AI talent or it's the small startups that need AI talent. And there's not a lot in the middle um there that would have like the regular traditional flow of recruitment for the large companies typically they're looking at bringing in talent under the h-one b category which of course has its limitations um such as just having a cap there's only a certain number of them that can come that way and it has specific requirements uh that might not fit well with uh some of the um AI minds out there. A lot of them are not even traditionally educated, but they are self-taught entrepreneurs. The other thing that brings up is the opportunities. A lot of times, small startups start as teams that are really cohesive, and it's not something where they need a lot of manpower to come on on a full-time basis to get their products off the ground. It may be something to where they need just some help here and there, to do some coding, but it's not something that would support doing a whole visa petition to bring someone on for multiple years. And they might not have the funding readily available to them to do the salary on top of the visa process. For the larger companies, I would say that, as I said before, the H-B program has its limitations, and they're not as keen on bringing a lot of folks in for AI under the O-I categories or E-B-II, things of that nature. That's why what we're going to do is we're going to approach the committee that is over executing the Biden administration's plan on AI to suggest some things. Because we think that it's more the entrepreneurial spirit of some of these AI companies, influencers, and agencies that would better support getting them over here quicker so they can come and do their own projects rather than waiting for a labor opportunity or an employment opportunity to come. So one of the things is like we want to stress that maybe they can get O one A's to do freelance work. They can get O one B categories so that whole teams of them can come as far as the main person getting an O one B visa and then them able to get their support staff under the O two visas. And then also advocate for ways to make it streamlined for them to do EB two with national interest waivers because that way they wouldn't need a labor offer either. And they'd be able to come and set up their own shop and make themselves available for on a project basis to the large employers. And then also to help out the smaller startups get out in a way that they wouldn't have to commit financially to them to get their visas and to do their salary. But that's just our thoughts and kind of what to look forward to from us. as we're going to put out a survey to the market to really find out how talent is being brought in from a global perspective on AI. And we're also going to be developing projects that will come out soon. So be on the lookout, and we should have some more content coming out soon. Thank you very much.",,x,,,
"Feb.09, 2024",Sherrod Seward_ Esq_ speaks on visa issues for minor league athletes,Immigration Sports,Sherrod Seward_ Esq_ speaks on visa issues for minor league athletes,Sherrod Seward_ Esq_ speaks on visa issues for minor league athletes (1).mp4,Sherrod Seward_ Esq_ speaks on visa issues for minor league athletes.mp3,"Adding myself to the stage. I thought it important to speak on this topic because it's coming up a lot in two major sports here in the United States where a lot of people come to compete at the minor league level. And that is soccer, football. I'm talking as is like the regular football and cricket. And these are both sports where there's a lot of minor league participation. And when I mean minor league, I'm not talking about the league that's right under MLS or U.S. Major Cricket. I think it's called the Major Cricket League or something like that. Major League Cricket. We're talking about third tier and fourth tier leagues where we're starting to get a lot of calls because there's a lot of issues and confusions about the ability of players to get visas to compete in these leagues. Now, the first question is, can you compete in these leagues on visitor visas? And the answer is yes, if you're not getting paid or if you're only getting paid prize money. But if you're getting paid anything that is anything other than that, like a stipend or a salary or even in-kind payment, then you're still going to have issues with work authorization if you're competing for this type of money that's not prize money in these minor league leagues. The other problem that we have is the eligibility of the individuals to obtain P-one visas and just the eligibility criteria. Let's deal with that first. A lot of times the talent that is coming to compete in these leagues, it's hard for them to satisfy the criteria of getting a P-one visa on their own. If you don't know, P-one visas are for internationally recognized athletes and there's certain categories that you have to feel to satisfy that if you're doing it as an individual. And that is like an international ranking, which you usually don't have if you're in a team sport or if you have individual awards that are awarded to you. But a lot of times team sports don't have, as opposed if you were a swimmer, which has a very robust international ranking system that's universally accepted or boxing, something like that matter. But in team sports, you tend not to have those type of accolades that make you applicable for a P-one visa on your own. But there is two ways that you can get P-one visas as a team. One is like as a team, you competed with some other people before and collectively you have international rankings, awards that make you satisfactory to the eligibility requirement of P-ones. The other is the Compete Act. And that is usually the best, most consistent way that athletes competing in minor leagues can get P-one visas. The Compete Act is applicable to leagues that have at least six teams and a collective revenue of over ten million dollars. While that might not seem like a lot, a lot of these sports leagues that are operating are not generating that type of money yet till they get to a certain threshold. And the problem that happens is if Well, here's a good thing. If you're under the Compete Act, you do not have to get the individual eligibility for each P-I visa. It's kind of assumed that the people that are competing have the eligibility portion of their visa satisfied. And it's great because this is where historically it comes from. Historically, minor league hockey teams used to use up all the H-B visas trying to get players during the winter months. And those H-B visas are typically held to the side for agricultural workers. are workers that work in seasonal amusement parks and stuff like that so to stop beating up on the quota of those h-to-bs during hockey season that's when they came up with the compete act so that hockey players could come on p-one visas even if they didn't have those eligibility requirements typical of international recognized athletes at a p-one level and leave the h-to-b cap on uh unmasked with So when I get players interested, both in cricket, football, and even basketball, interested in a visa, and they say they're playing with a minor league I've never heard before, it's always like, let me talk to the league first, see what type of revenue they have, because if they don't have the Compete Act, criteria met is going to be a very hard battle and probably you'll have to end up on a visitor visa and playing for free and not getting paid under the table that's bad all right so I hope that clears that up about how minor leagues the compete act and p-one visas all interact with each other to give either your great chance of coming here on a work visa to play with a minor league team or if it's just you're gonna have to wait and get your credentials up and become eligible for a individual P-one visa without the Compete Act. Hope you find that helpful and I'm going to try to do this more often. Thank you very much.",,x,,,
"Feb.01, 2024",Combat Sports - Executive Session - Sherrod Seward_ Esq_,Business Development or Marketing,Combat Sports - Executive Session - Sherrod Seward_ Esq_,Combat Sports - Executive Session - Sherrod Seward_ Esq_.mp4,Combat Sports - Executive Session - Sherrod Seward_ Esq_.mp3,"How's it going? I am Sherrod Seward. I'm an immigration attorney where historically I do a lot of work in combat sports starting in probably around two thousand nineteen. My first my second call for immigration work was a boxer from Nigeria to where I did my first P one. And since then, I've probably done hundreds of P-one visas and O-one visas for combat sports athletes from all over the world, from, you know, petitioners that are just managers that have one fighter all the way to some of the biggest promotions in the world, such as Top Rank, One Fighting Championships, Queensbury Promotions, Frank Warren have done some work that have helped out Matchroom and TGV, Premier Boxing Champions. But a lot of the work that I enjoyed the most was helping out the managers that were getting talent and helping them navigate their careers through these. Oh, I also have to shout out Salida Promotions, who was my first promotion client. Dimitri Salida, thank you very much. But going back to what my bread and butter was, and I say was because I'll explain in a little bit. obtained visas, P-one visas for managers that had fighters that were unsigned to major promotions. And the major advantage that there was when doing it like this is that the fighters had the leverage to compete for whatever B-side they wanted to on multiple promotions, which of course can lead to better opportunities and bigger paydays as opposed to doing an exclusive promotional contract with one promoter or the other. And when we do these visas like this, it's completely appropriate to base the visa on the projected schedules of the promotions. So if you have a manager, your manager's job is to place you on fight cards. They can place you on the fight cards of Matchroom, place you on the fight cards of Top Rank, Salida Promotions, and things like that. And for years, what we were able to do was to satisfy the itinerary portion of a P one. So if you have a P one visa, you need to be eligible. You have to have an international ranking, maybe some support letters to say that you are indeed a important internationally recognized athletes. But also you have to have an itinerary that shows that you will be competing in events that require the participation of internationally recognized athletes, which is very vague on what that means. But usually what it means is that they will not give you a P one. If you're competing on a little show that nobody sees, they will give you a P one. If you're competing on ESPN for top rank, they will give you a P one. If you're competing on the zone with match room, they will give you a P one. If you are competing on, um, Fox with, uh, PBC, right? So that's the reason why these large promotions need to be on the itineraries of P ones. Now, Do you need to be signed to these promotions or actually have a contract? That's not what the rules say. The rules say that if you have a US agent that is functioning as the employer, and what that means is navigating and directing the career of the applicant beneficiary, that is sufficient to establish the itinerary portion, which means that we don't have to do contracts. And this was happening a lot. And so that's why when we do a P-one, especially for a boxer and even O-ones too, we always include all of those promotions in the itinerary because otherwise they will not get approved because they do not have events that require the participation of internationally recognized athletes. And it wasn't about actually having fights signed up for that. It's more about the speculation that a manager who's doing their job can put people on those cards. And it works in other sports. For example, If you're a tennis player, you're not signed to the US Open. If you're a track athlete, you're not signed to the individual meets that you go and compete at. You qualify and then you go compete at those, right? So this was going fine for years. And then USCIS started saying that we want names and dates and locations of bouts for three years, which of course is impossible and stupid. And it can't possibly be the rules because you can't do that in other sports. For example, the NFL. They don't know the NFL schedule for next season is not out yet. We do not know when and where the Cleveland Browns will be playing on a week to week basis. The NBA schedule for next year is not created yet. Yet these sports and many other sports obtain multiple year P one visa approvals. And even if you're direct with the promotion, like I know the UFC Gets multiple year promotions and they don't say exactly when the fighter will be fighting. It's an impossible thing to ask. So what we did is we took them to federal court and I'm not going to show you my screen to show you the history of our battles, which we're doing for the fighters. We went and litigated because we wanted independent fighters to be have the privilege. and the ability to go get P-one visas without being signed to major promotions, and to be able to use the itineraries of those major promotions to get the P-ones. Because if they're doing little shows, they will not get approved for P-one visas based on not having an itinerary that supports internationally recognized athletes. So I'm going to share my screen so we can talk about this. All right. So we filed federal lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services a good three to four times. The first time we did this was for an athlete named Victoria Dudakova. And first round management had the courage to allow us to go and pursue this litigation, federal court in Florida. And we won. And basically, the situation here was is we said that she would be competing in the UFC and Dana White's contender series based on the strength that her employer, first round management, which serves that they don't pay her directly. Their U.S. agent functioning as employer has a history of placing athletes in the organization. We can show that first round management consistently places athletes in the UFC, which means that more likely than not, this athlete will also be competing in the UFC. So we sued them and almost immediately they reopened the case and approved it because they did not want it going to court and getting decided on and getting precedent. So that's how we won this case. And that's what this press release is around here is that we sued them in two thousand twenty two. We won. They approved the case. And this was to set it in stone that we're going to stand up against them and not allow them to only give multiple year P-ones to fighters that have major promotion signing. Because that gives too much leverage to the promoters to be like, hey, not only we're going to push down your purse and tell you who to fight because we control your visa. If there's no us, there's no visa. And so we're going to do what we want, which promoters have used as tremendous leverage to get fighters to do things they don't want to do for prices they want to do it at. So what happened with this is we took this decision and we put evidence of this decision in every P one visa application that we're sending out to say like, Hey, we took this to court. We won and this should be followed about a year later. And this was probably after COVID when COVID happened, uh, all the travel got shut down, but we were able to place. several promotions on the presidential exemption list to where we can basically send an email to the White House and get people exempted from the travel ban, which was a tremendous work on our part because like the only other organizations at the time that were able to do that were like the NFL, Major League Soccer, the UFC and stuff like that. And then the promotions that I put on there before it became more popular to do that. But what started happening is that they went again to fighting the itinerary and requiring that fighters show names dates and locations of every fight they have for the extent of that visa and there's no way any fighter knows who they're going to fight after their next their next fight they could be hurt opponents drop out they go up and down the rankings it's just an asinine thing to ask so what we did is we um Let's see if I can find, because it's just supposed to be up, this right here. This is what we did. This is coming up. So what we did is this. Since they were doing that, we needed to have proof on an industry standard variety that this is the way we do business in combat sports. So I put it on our website and I sent it in a newsletter to say, hey, can people sign this petition? Put your name, your role in the industry, and say that these are the industry standards in combat sports. It says that bout agreements are a formality once stuff is already signed. Like, we're not going to have bout agreements for three years. It's going to say that in general, promotions always want fighters that are ranked within the top six hundred in the world for B-side opportunities at best. And things of this nature. which basically say in contracts for exclusive promotional agreements, they say ultimately the fighter is responsible for their own visa work, even though in the UFC and top rank, they will get visas for the fighter. It's actually in the contract that the fighter is supposed to get their own visa. How could it be both ways, right? So we had maybe eighty or so people sign this letter. And what we did with this letter is we took it all together and we introduced it as general evidence of how the combat sports industry works. We did not supply this information as this is about a particular fighter over here, a particular fighter over here. Later down the year, we filed another lawsuit in Boston, the Federal District of Massachusetts, for a fighter that was denied on a similar reason about itinerary. And what they did this time was I said that they'll be competing in an organization that has broadcasts on UFC Fight Pass. These dumbasses went and looked at the UFC schedule and said, we don't see them fighting in that, which is that it's not even boxing. They looked at the MMA schedule and said they didn't see the guy there and said, that's why we denied the visa. So needless to say, when I pointed that out in federal litigation, and just by the fact I litigated them anyway, they got pretty pissed off. And so what they did was something quite dirty. And the story needs to be told. I'm going to show you what they did. Now, mind you, these letters are signed by eighty people around the world. And it was publicly available on my website and circulated to thousands of contacts. And subsequently presented as general evidence of how the combat industry works. All right. So this is a link that anybody can see that talks about this story. We wanted the litigation. They opened the case, and they approved it. Reopened, and you see the approval. Now, this is what these guys did. The federal government did this. Let me see if I can make this bigger so you can see. It's not really working. But I will tell you what this is. For everybody that signed this letter, they went and sent an email to them asking the following thing. Can you verify that this letter contains your signature, their E-signature? And they said it about a particular fighter that has won fighting championships. They said, do you know this fighter that's with this promoter and this thing, which is unethical because That puts the onus on whoever seen this thinking like their letter was submitted to support a particular athlete when it was not. These letters were gathered to explain the general industry standards in combat sports. But they sent a message like this to everyone that signed that letter. Do you know one fighting championship? Do you know this particular mixed martial art athlete? To which most people called my office and I told them how to respond and they responded that way. There were two individuals that got scared and lied and said that they did not authorize the letter. One of these people was a competitor of One Fighting Championship. That organization is now defunct and no longer in combat sports. So I don't know their motivation if it was that they just got scared. I don't know if their motivation is that they saw this as an opportunity to dig at one of their competitors. or if it was they're on the way out the door anyway, and they just wanted to blow shit up. I don't know. But we're going to find a way to find out. But that's what happened. They went and emailed this unethical and just wrong and misinformed message to everyone. that makes it seem like their letters were meant to go to about a certain promoter and a certain fighter when they were presented as general evidence as how the combat sports industry works. There are dozens of people that contacted them back and said, like, yes, it is. Two people said no, even though it's not true. And what they did as a result is we had to basically drop the suit because parties that were involved in the suit no longer wanted to do this because they were they felt too much pressure from the government which was immense and we did too and we're still fitting the brunt of it as a brunt there was a lot of visas revoked because they contained these two letters in them but the reason that this happened is because the visas would not have been approved in the first place if we did not base them on one the itineraries of major promotions which in mixed martial arts would have been Bellator, PFL, and the UFC. If it's boxing, it would have been Matchroom, Top Rank, Salida Promotions, and sometimes Premier Boxing Championships, which is just a general way that we put in itineraries because otherwise the visas would not be approved in the first place. We then had to go and get all these letters from around the world to try to explain that unsigned fighters are generally wanted by these big promoters in order to further supplant our itinerary arguments when they started denying visas for the itinerary portion again even after the litigation so that's what happened and we had to withdraw the suit because there's just too much pressure after they did this dirty thing and so what we need to do is as a community tell the story of how they did this dirty thing and um fight back because without this, it's only going to be the major promoters that are allowed to get visas for fighters. And that's going to drive their prices down and take a lot of leverage away from the fighters to be able to negotiate where and when they want to compete. All right. So that's the story of what happened. And I will make those links available to this explanation on what happened. I would love to get the opportunity to litigate again. Right. So like right here, this is how the evidence was submitted in the petitions. It says clarification on industry standard practices in combat sports. And it has the same standards that are in the letter that was sent. This does not say like, hey, I'm trying to say this is about a particular fighter. This is about all fighters. This is about the whole industry. But they did this dirty thing. and misguided people by saying like, hey, do you know this particular person in that particular promotion? Which was not at all how the evidence was presented. All right. So with that said, I'll get into a little question and answer. We had some questions come in. I'm going to stop sharing the screen and come back in to answer these questions before we go out. What are my options if my visa gets a notice of revocation? That's a great question. So the easiest way to go about it is just respond and just respond with evidence that you have either a bout coming up or that promoters are interested in having you compete. Because now we actually have to show as a result of this that you will tangibly have fights that we can't just base it off of the itinerary of major promotions. You have to go and actually show interest. You don't need to actually about contract, but usually like, you know, if you have an email from promoter saying like, hey, I'm interested in using you on this date, or if I go to your box rec and you have something on there, that's what a rep will promoter, that will help get it over the hump and respond as a revocation. Also, what we're doing for clients that have revocation notice is we'll file another P-one at a reduced rate. If you don't have, but you have to have an itinerary, you have to have fights lined up for an interest from a promoter to do that. The other way to look at it is we can switch you to a B-one visa so that you can maintain your status while you wait for your next opportunity to come up with a promoter. And then the promoter can get a P-one visa on your behalf. The other way to do it is we can get you a visa as essential support staff if you train with somebody that's on a P-one or O-one visa. We can do it that way. And we do that as a courtesy to the community. Probably going forward, combat sports is not a focus of our practice. But we like fighters and respect fighters, and we'll always advocate for them. So this is more of a helpful thing that we're doing to the industry. But if we do get the opportunity to litigate, we'll be excited about it. But we just have to wait for the right case and the right clients that have the courage to go see this through. Because as you can see, this is going to be a pretty dirty business. But no, we'll do that for the fighters. We don't mind getting dirty. But we got to have partners with us that will see that they can do stuff like I just explained to you and withstand that. Because I can't just file a lawsuit on my own behalf. There has to be a fighter involved and a petitioner. Next question. What to do about fighters and coaches getting rejected at the consulate? That's another great question. So another thing that's happening is that even when fighters have approved visas, they're going to the consulate, especially in places like Uzbekistan, sometimes like Mexico too, and West Africa as well, where they'll not stamp the passport with the visa, usually citing that they don't have enough ties to their home country. Basically, they're saying, we don't trust that you'll come to the United States and leave when your work authorization is over. There's a couple of things to do about that. One is, If you have the ability to file for an O-one visa, an O-one visa has dual intent, which means you can go to the consulate, tell them like, yeah, I'm never coming back here. And they can't do anything about it because it's perfectly fine under the dual intent to say like, yes, I do plan to immigrate under the O-one. Under the P-one is different. So under the P one, if you're getting rejected, we probably have to do a congressional inquiry, which is where we'll go to the Senator's office or the U S house of representatives office, where the petitioner is and get them to inquire and put a special notice to the consulate that like, Hey, there's people paying attention to this. You should know. And while it doesn't automatically get the results you want, a lot of times they're hesitant to do BS things when they know that there is a federal officer. or a federal representative that's looking at this too. It's not just a random person coming in and trying to get through. The next question is, what are the best options for fighters looking for visas to come to the US to do bare knuckle boxing? Great question. Bare knuckle boxers are eligible for P-I visas and O-I visas. The thing is, it's just a little bit harder to prove a P-I visa in bare knuckle boxing because it's not like bare knuckle boxing is on BoxRec. There's no official world ranking for bare knuckle boxing. So a lot of times we have to get the athlete eligible as a combat sports athlete. We don't call them a bare knuckle boxer. or a martial artist, whatever they would be, because a lot of people that compete in bare knuckle boxing are doing it for the first time. They're actually a mixed martial artist or they're a boxer, a Sambo athlete. You know, there's not a world ranking system for bare knuckle boxing. A lot of these people have different type of backgrounds. So what we do is we call them whatever background that there is or we make it general. And then we also put itinerary for events that are not just bare knuckle boxing, but maybe they're doing jujitsu, boxing, stuff like that. And then There's not a lot of bare knuckle promotions that are big enough to support P ones by themselves. You have BKFC, which of course, if you have a B BKFC letter of interest or an email from their branch promoter, um, or even David Feldman, that will go a long way towards getting the itinerary portion of your P one across the board. But on eligibility, we have to work hard there because there's no international rankings for bare knuckle boxing yet. It's not on box, right? If somebody made an international ranking, that would be great, and it'd be a lot easier for bare-knuckle boxers to get P-Ones as opposed to having to get O-One visas. What are the best options for fighters no longer competing? Great question. So if you're not competing, and even if you are, the O-One visa is a great option because you do not have to compete at all to be on an O-One visa. And a lot of times we put world champion-level athletes like Bivol and – well, no, Bivol is no P-One. But like Tyson Fury, Canelo Alvarez, a lot of the champions with top rank, we put them on O-one visas because one, we don't have to deal with the itinerary battle that we have with P-one visas. And also they can stuff their itinerary with a lot more than boxing. You know, Tyson Fury likes to wrestle. Canelo Alvarez might have a bunch of business investments that have nothing to do with competing in the ring. And the other thing is when you stuff your itinerary on an O-one with those other activities, you can get essential support staff. So if you have any itinerary that'll be opening at kitchen, then you can get O-two visas for chefs. If you say I'm going to be making apparel, then you can get O-two visas for people that run merchandise. If you want a P one visa and then you can only get like coaches, dieticians, stuff like that that's relative to your competing. You can't get essential support staff to help with the other parts of your itinerary. All right. And that's the last question we have. Thank you for tuning in. And I'm sorry to have to deliver this unfortunate news, but it doesn't have to last forever. Help me fight it. know that everything I've done in combat sports is to help the industry because I love fighters and that was how I got started in this business and uh I believe strongly that independent fighters deserve to be rewarded with p-one and o-one approvals that allows them to stay independent and choose when where and who they want to compete with I also believe that smaller promoters and managers should be privy to the authority to obtain visas for their clients and direct and navigate where they will compete, who they will compete against, and how much they'll compete for. I've laid out what we are willing to do to combat persons that have gotten notices of revocation to help you out. Just contact the office, and the office will give you those options and the prices on that. But I don't regret going to court. ensuing those guys look forward to doing it again. But we need strength and unity because as you said, like I just showed you, they can do any type of dirty stuff to make it hard for independent fighters to do their thing. And perhaps they're powerful lobbyists with these major promoters or the broadcasters are affiliated with these major promoters. If you catch what I'm saying in between the line. You know which promoters broadcast with who, and you know they have lots of lawyers and lots of lobbyists and lots of friends in the highest places. And they're not your friends. But not mine either. So let's fight them together, friends. We'll be able to fight another day. Talk to you soon. Love the industry. I'm still here, still fighting. Peace out.",,x,,,

Perfect. Thanks, Sharad. So, yeah, my name is, so it's unusual spelling, but pronounced like Sean, but you're not the first one to do that. I am. Yeah, exactly. I'm used to it. So, yeah, as Sharad said, I'm based in Dubai in the UAE, but as my accent suggests, I'm originally from the U.S. and actually from North Carolina, where I understand, Sharad, that's where you are right now. But I'm with Henley and Partners. So Henley and Partners, we are a global leader in residence and citizenship by investment, which is an industry known more broadly as investment migration. Many people aren't familiar super very intimately with investment migration, but essentially these residence and citizenship by investment programs are, ways by which private investors uh successful individuals entrepreneurs um and their families and obtain legal residence and or citizenship by making an economic investment of of a variety of sorts depending on the country uh into that uh into a into a given country and um you know receive those residence or citizenship benefits uh as a result so why this is important you know as we hear every day, you know, the world is increasingly interconnected and dynamic and ever changing, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. And as a result, countries are have in competition with one another for the best talent for capital. And and these programs are designed as a way to attract that talent and capital from from successful individuals. And for those for those investors, it's kind of a buyer's market. In that respect, there are so many options to choose from. And so they come to us to for guidance on which of these programs or which combination of investment migration programs around the world might be best for their family, for their interests, if they are looking for safety, for education access for their children, for the ability to work in another market, or a combination of these things, then we can guide them on how to be the most mobile, the most, you know, kind of most international kind of being able to participate in that global economy. So we provide private client advisory. We work with governments on designing and implementing investment migration programs in new countries. And then we publish insights about the industry as well, the migration trends of successful high net worth individuals. A few weeks ago, we released what we call the Henley Passport Index, which often gets picked up in a lot of different outlets and got some good coverage a couple of weeks ago, ranking the strongest passports. So the passports that have the most diverse or the broadest RISA-free travel access, which is one of the big draws, but not the only one. Question for you right there. Yeah. Talking about the passport index. What are, what would you say like kind of like in the top five right now as far as like the powerful passports in the world that have these migration investment programs? Yeah, great question. So the global passport ranking right now, this was kind of the first time that it's been so tight at the top. So there were six countries that were tied for the strongest in terms of their visa-free travel access. So France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and Spain. Citizens of those countries have one hundred and ninety four different countries or jurisdictions around the world where they can travel visa free. Now, how far down the list is the United States right now? You know, it's funny, we are down at I think we I don't think we slipped any further. I think we stayed at seventh. Yeah, we're at seventh again now. It's funny. So for the U.S., We've fallen a couple of places over the past few years, but not necessarily because, you know, we don't have any fewer destinations where we can travel. It's just that some of these other countries have increased the number of countries where they can travel visa free. You know, there's a number of reasons for that. I think it's no secret that the U.S. is very, very strict when it comes to immigration policy. So we aren't. Yeah, there aren't as many new countries. New destinations, but we're not, you know, it's not like you can't travel places where you used to be able to with the U.S. passport. And then this kind of like to educate people. I think another reason maybe it won't show up on the passport index is that. But in the United States, the investment migration pathways through the EB-Five investment program and that program is not as easy, I would say, as it as it used to be. Because one thing is you have to do the investment, which is probably at least around a million dollars. There's different ways to get into it if you go to the regional center and stuff. But the part that people don't think about is that you have to have ten American jobs at the end of the day per your investment, which is actually very difficult to do when you know that most startup businesses in the United States fail. And so while you can do your investment, it's almost like, can you get your conditions removed two years down the line when they come and audit you for seeing if you if your investment did lead to those ten American jobs. And I imagine that there's other countries out there that once you make your investment, you're pretty much set, ready to go. And there's no like kind of like audit two years that we're like, hey, how did that how did that investment go and turn out into like jobs in our in our thing, which is it's hard. Like if you have ten employees on a million dollar investment, I don't know. It might take a lot more than that. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Right. And that's why I like to focus on the talent based immigration as opposed to the investment based myself, just because there is no job category or minimum investment. for that matter. Right, right. Very, yeah, good point. And I should say, you know, as one of the ways that we have tried to approach our EB-Five strategy, you know, because it's such a strict program is, you know, we work with developers that have regional center approved projects that investors can enter under the EB-Five program. And because they're part of a larger existing project that has been organized through a regional center and has all of the accreditation and all of the data to support job creation, it makes it a little bit easier for investors to make the qualifying either eight hundred thousand or one million dollar investment for EB-Five. And the project team in place that's running the commercial enterprise has already is responsible for handling the job creation and demonstrating the justification. So it's hard to find the right partners. And that's one of the things we work really hard to do is to find to find projects that will meet all the criteria. But, you know, I think for like, you know, to your point, investors who are looking to do it on their own, it's, it's really difficult. It's, it's yeah, it's, it's not easy. And that's where I got to give Henley and partners kudos because there's a lot of agents that are out there in the world when it comes to EB five investment. But since Henley and partners, not only does migration investment here in the United States, but all around the world, I feel like for so many years, you guys have a unique vision to see if a project is going to work or not, you know, and that value alone to say like, Hey, especially when you talk about EB five and maybe some of the other countries as well, where you have to have followups on your investment, having the right partner that have seen it all around the world, and maybe even help develop some of those programs just goes a long way because if the project is not viable, it defeats the purpose of the entire, the entire investment. Absolutely. And that's a huge part of what we do globally, to your point. As I alluded to earlier, depending on the country, depending on the program, the type of investment that qualifies an individual for either citizenship or residence can be real estate, it can be an investment fund, it can be a diversified investment shares of a publicly traded company, for example. And a lot of investors, like you've said, there are a lot of subprime, suboptimal products out there that not only will result in, could result in a loss for the investor, but they undermine the credibility of the program. If all of a sudden people are coming in and investing in these kind of, for lack of a better word, like almost bogus projects then they aren't happy even if they receive their residence permit a few years down the line when they want to sell that asset it's lost a lot of its value and the program doesn't look good the country isn't able to attract the right talent um so yeah you're exactly right that's a huge huge part of you know what we're what we're able to offer right and um it's like a segue speaking of talent yeah um one of the things that henley and partners is is working on is uh working with athletes and other individuals that are high on the talent side, not just business people, but people that have some of the best skill sets in sports and entertainment in the world. And I definitely want to open a floor to talk about that new program and why it makes sense. And where are people trying to go? Where are the athletes trying to go? We're trying to go hang out with them. Where are they going? Yeah, absolutely. So it's, it's like you said, it's a new, new area of exploration for us so we work with a huge range of different you know individuals from a huge range of different industries you know there's there's no one pathway to success and and so our our clients are representative of that but we did start and we started to get a few more inquiries from high level athletes or their managers or their families, kind of personal assistant, whatever the case may be, reaching out to us and asking about these services. So one example, so here in the UAE, there was a former or a West African soccer player who was competing previously in Europe. He was able to travel without any issue in Europe while he was playing. His work permit was supported. His residence status in the EU was totally taken care of. But then a couple of years later, he's retired. He's back in his home country. And that level of access that he had when he was still playing is no longer available to him. So we had a few cases like that that led us to think, OK, you know, Maybe there's more here. We haven't done a lot to proactively engage with the sports community, but there must be something more here. And the more we looked into it, the more we came to realize, as you know very well, there are specific visa pathways in many countries that are that are either designed specifically for athletes or that are very commonly utilized with athletes. So in the U S O one P one, you know, all of your, your bread and butter. Um, and that in and of itself is a, is a, is a type of investment migration, but it's an investment in that athletes of that athletes, human capital of their, of their abilities, um, of their talent. I always, I think of like, um and I was I was thinking about this podcast and the the quote that kept coming up was when lebron in his press conference said he was taking his talents to south beach right it's like no I know you're a cleveland guy right I'm sorry I was see I was a block away from the queue when that happened yes I was at rj boland's I remember like it was yesterday it got really quiet and we like what did he say yeah Sorry, I should have cleared that one with you before. But it's a cool, you know, it's a type of domestic investment migration, but it's an athlete taking his capital and investing it in a new franchise. And I'm sure there's been studies about the GDP bump that Florida and Miami saw as a result of him. And that's the same concept for Florida. countries around the world. They want to attract athletes to invest their human capital, their abilities in their economy. And, you know, just the same as they want to bring in business and money. Like, yeah, it's a good book. And I guess I guess for our audience, that's not familiar with talent based investment immigration. I'll just briefly like go over. Yeah, of course. So in the United States, For athletes, there's something called the P-I visa, which is the work visa you get when you're actually competing. Now, after they compete, and sometimes while they're competing, we get them the O-I visa. The O-I visa is for foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities. Now, it applies to athletes, but it can also apply to business people, too. It can apply to pretty much any industry, as long as we can prove that you're at the top tier of that. So how we work with athletes is, for example, we do the visa work for Canelo Alvarez and Tyson Fury, who are both of the most talented boxers in the world. But they do a lot more than box. Like Tyson, he might be wrestling. Canelo Alvarez might be opening restaurants. And the thing is, these O-one visas do not have a minimum investment, but you can come in and invest as much as you want. depending how it's structured, you can open up multiple businesses and you don't have to stay in the United States for any amount of time. So if you get an EV five or permanent residence, there's a certain amount of time you have to stay in the United States to keep it. If you have a talent based visa, you can come in a couple of days a month. What you need to do and you can actually avoid having the American taxation because you're not even in the United States to trigger that one hundred eighty day rule where you start having to pay American income tax. So In a lot of ways, if you're an athlete or a talent-based person, doing the O-One, if you don't want to actually live in the United States, you just want to have access to the market, can be a great segue to just kind of test the market, see how you like it, and then decide later if you want to do permanent residence. And then when you do want to do permanent residence, there is an immigrant, a green card version of the O-One called the EB-A. which also doesn't require any investment at all. And there's no requirement for you to create American jobs. It's basically, we take your O-one arguments, bolster them up, and we apply for the I-forty-five, which is the green card here in the United States, permanent residence. And it's very clean. And it's like it gives you a lot of options, and the O-one can be done very quickly. And I know there's other countries out there that have talent-based immigration that probably works the same way. Yeah, absolutely. So Australia is one that comes to mind with me. They have kind of a similar setup as the US where they have one. Well, they had it's currently not active, but we're expecting or hoping for some kind of a revamped version of it. But they have a business investor visa pathway for investors. individuals who are you know investors looking to obtain residence permits in australia and then they have what's called the global talent independent program which is for just like what you were saying with the o-one and ev-one-a for individuals at the top of their you know leaders in their field exemplary individuals um who who you know are looking to enter Australia purely on the merits of their talent and expertise. So we, you know, that's absolutely an example. Well, I think what we were, what we did, you know, what we found, though, is, or in many countries, absolutely, you know, the talent based visas, while they are competing are hugely, you know, hugely beneficial, but in certain countries it's it's you know the window during which an individual can access those you know those benefits is fairly small you know and it's limited to the time that they're at the top of their game you know the five ten years fifteen if they're really lucky where they're competing internationally and can benefit from you know that that sponsorship so that's kind of you know what got us thinking more is you know how can we or or is there a is there a what is the value, what could be the other ways for athletes to diversify how they're investing in their own mobility, right? So one, just as an example, something that happened last summer while we were starting kind of the ideation process for this project was Harry Kane, the English footballer or captain of the English soccer, national soccer team. Exactly. He transferred from Tottenham Hotspur, one of the top teams in England, to Bayern Munich in Germany. It happened very quickly. And within, I think, something crazy like seventy two hours, he was in Germany on the pitch competing in a match, basically working for his new employer in a new part of the world, in a new country where he had to go through all of the ins and outs of the immigration process and did so in seventy two hours. the resources at his disposal are hard to like fathom that he was able to do that. Yeah. It's incredible. It's, you know, but even so a few months later, he gave an interview after a match when they asked him, you know, how's the transition going? And he, he said, you know, The most difficult part is all the stuff off the pitch that he needed to figure out. He said work permit, finding housing, finding schools for his kids. And this is someone who, again, has unbelievable resources at his disposal. So imagine then what it must be like for – An athlete who's, you know, more of a journeyman athlete, plays for a few teams, you know, a team for a couple seasons, then gets transferred to maybe a different league or maybe even in a different country. Just, you know, a career athlete, not within, you know, not elite elite, but still successful enough to have a long career. How does someone like that navigate the constant change? And I think the answer for many athletes could be, and is already, but could be for even more, investment migration, putting investments in place while they are still competing and that will grant them access to residents in Spain, residents in Greece, a second citizenship from the Caribbean that gives them widespread visa-free travel access to Europe, to the UK, to the British Commonwealth. There are some steps that athletes can take so that when the end of their career comes, whether it's on their own know on their own time on their own terms or you know unfortunately you know if it's an injury that ends their career unexpectedly they're not in a place where they need to immediately up and leave you know take their kids out of school relocate and and lose the ability to access these markets that um that they had access to when they were when they were competing so that's That's the concept that we're exploring, and we're getting some really good interest, I think. Awesome. When I speak to people, it's like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. I get it. And one thing I definitely want you to elaborate on is it's not just the migration part. So what Harry Kane said, it's all the stuff, where my kids go to school, all that. I want them to know Henley & Partners is not just an investment. um advisor it's on practical things so can you kind of speak to like all the practical things that henley and partners helps with with um their clients when it comes to housing school stuff like that absolutely so we are yeah we are very you know kind of broad spectrum in terms of what we can help with. Uh, some, some clients, they come to us and they're just looking for, um, ease of travel. So, you know, we, we find them the right program, but others are looking to relocate completely. And they're thinking about, okay, where can I, you know, what, what properties should I purchase? Where's the market strongest? What's going to be a good investment. Um, you know, others are thinking, okay, I, you know, I'm, thinking about where I'm gonna send my children to school when it comes to their secondary or tertiary and beyond. And that's where we're really able to provide extra service. So not only do we assist in the application process for whichever program they've chosen, but we have a tax advisory wing, we have an education services advisory wing, we have our own real estate company. So we are doing intensive due diligence on real estate, understanding trends in the market, which, which parts of, you know, outside of Athens or, or which, which parts of Spain, um, have the best potential for, you know, uh, for returns from a real estate standpoint, but also, you know, which developments in, in, um, another example, uh, I'll go back to Greece, have schools that have real estate options that are closest to the British International School, for example. So we're able to provide those custom insights and our education services team can work with children from as early as the family wishes to provide assessments, to provide guidance, counseling, understanding which educational opportunities are going to be available to that student based on their academic profile, and then working with the client advisory team like myself on which programs then can be paired with education opportunities that best fit that um that that family and that and that student so yeah and these are the things that we've realized you know they don't they apply to everyone they're not just for you know successful business people I mean athletes they're they're they're humans they have families they have children they're thinking about where and when they're going to need to access new markets if they're accustomed to competing internationally and moving around with their families. Yeah, I think there's a lot of value that we can add to athletes throughout their career as they prepare for the eventuality of no longer being active athletes competing on the top level. Right. And one thing, also getting to the practicality, When somebody calls Henley and Partners, what does the process look like? Who do they meet with? What does that onboarding process look like when athletes, talents, and business people contact Henley and Partners and want to get started with advisement? Absolutely. There are so many programs that we advise on, almost forty programs around the world. over a hundred countries globally that offer some sort of investment migration program, but we advise on those with the best reputation, most efficient processes, the best kind of due diligence standards to make sure that the right individuals are applying for and receiving these residences or citizenships. So because we offer, you know, forty different options, there's no, we never lead with what we think is the best. We really put a focus on understanding who the client is when they approach us. Before we recommend any specific program, we want to Understand if there's a geographic area where they're considering, if there are specific investment types that they prefer, if they're doing it for the purpose of relocation or just as an option that they might need or take advantage of later down the road. want to understand where they're coming from at that point we'll start to you know narrow it down present them with some you know the the financial layout of what that in what a specific program might look like um and then once we once we onboard them as a client we work hand in hand with putting together the entire application uh packet so to speak Understanding our team has been doing it for long enough that whenever someone comes to us and we get an understanding of who they are, what their background is, what their employment professional history is, exactly what documents will be needed and what signatures go where, what needs to be legalized here and there to set that individual up for success ultimately in their application. providing, you know, pairing them with the right investment, making sure that the investment that they make qualifies under the program. And yeah, and, you know, when we're there, start to finish and beyond, you know, once someone is handling a partner's client, they remain, you know, we, As much or as little as they want us, in the future, we're there. They're a client for life. We pride ourselves in being as A to Z as possible. That's awesome. Speaking of being in forty plus markets, there is a new office in the United States and you guys chose to take your talents also to Miami. I don't know. That's correct. There's something in the water. I've actually chosen to take my talents also to Miami as we have our office in operations now in West Palm Beach. Now I think about it because I can't take... There you go. You can't, yeah. I can't talk too much. No, exactly. So... the decision to open the office in the United States, in Miami, can we talk about that and say, like, is it because there's an increased interest in coming United States and when people are coming to United States, are they willing to come to South Florida? I mean, here in the United States, we like to move to South Florida as well. Right. So it's actually I think, you know, the EB-Five market for us is certainly and again, that's the U.S. Residence by Investment program. It is a popular program for our clients, but truthfully, I think the main reason why we've increased our footprint in the US is because a growing number of Americans are looking to have some options. And I think major cities, Miami, New York, Chicago, LA, there are a lot of individuals who are looking at their backup plan, whether it's, again, retiring in Spain, Costa Rica, Panama, the Caribbean, or just having, you know, having some options. It's all about, I think there's given political division, instability, you know, just general kind of global geopolitical I think people are recognizing that it's not enough to just have the one citizenship or one residence. It's a necessary part of any wealth protection kind of estate planning strategy to have access to as many markets as possible. So yeah, as much as people are looking to migrate to the US, I think a huge part of what we're doing and actually, and that's the thing, it's not necessarily even leaving the U S it's, it's a lot of, you know, a lot of our clients, yeah, it's, it's having that option. And I think that's a big, um, you know, uh, miss kind of misconception of, of the investment migration space is it's not about necessarily relocating. Um, we have so many clients here in the UAE who have long, uh, know, long careers long, you know, they've they've been working and living in the UAE for decades, and they don't intend on leaving right away or for the foreseeable future, but they just, they want to have some options, you know, they want to they want to be able to, yeah, be mobile as much as possible. So it's something we're seeing all over the world. But yeah, the US is a really fast growing market for us for sure. And I think it's one thing to just know the flexibility. And with the talent-based immigration, and I imagine it's going to be in other places too, is that it does offer a lot of flexibility. Sometimes even more flexibility than having the second permanent residence because sometimes with the permanent residence comes compliance things you have to do as far as how much time that you have to spend in a country and stuff like that. But I know here in the United States, when it comes to the old one category, you have that flexibility to be able to come to the United States, not have to stay here for any amount of time, and then have that option always to switch over to a talent-based immigrant version, which in our case is the EB-A, to do the permanent residence when you want to. But when it comes to flexibility, I think I want people to understand that if you are eligible for talent-based immigration, a lot of times you can do that without the red tape that comes with actually switching over to permanent residence if you're trying to just get your feet wet and being able to go different markets whenever you want to. also with the work authorization to make investments, but without that permanent commitment or semi-permanent commitment that comes with doing permanent residence in a lot of the most developed countries in the world. Yeah, that's a great, great point. There are programs where that's the case for investment migration as well, where I've mentioned Spain and Greece, Portugal a few times, but these programs, if you make a qualifying investment and go through the application process, etc., and receive your residence, if you don't want to, you don't have to spend a single day in that country, but you still retain your residence permit because you hold that qualifying asset. In some of these countries, it gives you Having that permit, regardless of whether or not you spend a day there, if you wanted to move there tomorrow and look for work, you could, in some cases, actually, Spain being one, you could be employed in Spain. It gives you that option of later, if you do have the talent of, if you're an entrepreneur and you want to start a new business and you already have your foot in the door to then use your talents to switch away from an investment or from a real estate-based pathway and settle in that country more permanently. I think what we've seen is the blurring between investment migration and talent-based migration is becoming more and more pronounced. They're becoming, in certain countries and certain programs, part of the same conversation. That's awesome. That's awesome. Well, we want, I guess we've been over like, thirty minutes. We don't want to take people's too much time. I know people are trying to get to work and go to bed and stuff like that. So I guess we'll wrap it up with talking about just, there is a lot of turmoil going in the world and stuff like that. When it comes, like, when you're having these conversations, like, with people, what are, like, the top three reasons that people might not even have on their brains that they should be thinking about to getting started with looking at their global migration through investment options right now in practical sense? Yeah. The things that people need to keep in mind are whether they are looking at relocating versus Just having the option because there are some programs that do require relocation. Are you looking for alternate? Some people don't recognize that even the difference between citizenship and residence. Citizenship, you become a naturalized citizen where you would hold passport of that country. Certain countries, depending on where you're from, don't allow for dual citizenship. So you need to be really aware of does your home country allow for dual citizenship or would obtaining another citizenship mean renouncing your current one, which can have major, major implications depending on where you're coming from. Major implications. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Huge. Those are the two biggest that we that we. that we hear about or that we encounter. And then the third that is a huge consideration that doesn't always fall under Henley and Partners scope is tax. You know, we're not tax advisors, but for anyone who comes our way, you know, we say, if you're thinking about this, just even if there won't be major impacts on you and your family in your situation, speak to a tax advisor, understand the implications, just so you're informed. I think that's, at the end of the day, we want our clients to feel like they are well-informed, well-educated, and that is what ultimately will allow them to make the right decision and will allow us to serve them the best and making sure that every decision they make is in their best interest. Gotcha. That's one of them. I think what I'll wrap it up with is, as an immigration attorney in the United States, I have enough to do with just knowing how immigration in the United States works. To have a resource out there like Henley & Partners that can go and give you these type of real practical questions that really matter is unique, unique. And we're certainly glad that Henley & Partners exists to be able to give such a broad perspective on immigration like around the world.

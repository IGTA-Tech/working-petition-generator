# Beneficiary Title & Professional Descriptor Research Guide

## Purpose

This document provides critical instructions for analyzing the beneficiary's job title and professional descriptors BEFORE conducting automated research. The title used to describe the beneficiary directly impacts:

1. **Evidence Scope**: What sources are relevant vs. irrelevant
2. **Criterion Strategy**: Which O-1 criteria are strongest
3. **Research Keywords**: What terms to prioritize in searches
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Who the peer group is for benchmarking

**CRITICAL**: This analysis must be completed BEFORE the 4-phase Perplexity research begins, as it determines the entire research strategy.

---

## Why Title Analysis Matters

### The Title Scope Problem

Different titles create different evidence boundaries:

| Title | Evidence Scope | Example Impact |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| "World-class athlete" | **BROAD** - All athletic achievements, endorsements, media, business ventures, social impact | Can use Instagram followers, endorsement deals, charity work |
| "Professional tennis player" | **MEDIUM** - Tennis rankings, tournament results, tennis-specific media, tennis endorsements | Must focus on tennis achievements; CrossFit training posts are irrelevant |
| "ATP Tour competitor" | **NARROW** - Only ATP-sanctioned events, official ATP rankings, ATP media | Challenger tour wins may not count; must be ATP-level |
| "Tennis professional and coach" | **SPLIT FOCUS** - Both playing AND coaching achievements needed | Need evidence in BOTH domains; strong in one area isn't enough |

### Real-World Example: MMA Fighter

**Scenario**: Beneficiary described as "professional MMA fighter"

**Title Analysis**:
- **Professional** = Must show paid competition (not amateur)
- **MMA** = Mixed Martial Arts specifically (not just boxing, not just jiu-jitsu)
- **Fighter** = Active competitor (not retired legend, not just coach)

**Research Implications**:
- ✅ Tapology rankings (MMA-specific)
- ✅ UFC/Bellator/ONE Championship records
- ✅ MMA media coverage (MMA Fighting, Sherdog)
- ❌ Boxing-only achievements (different sport)
- ❌ Jiu-jitsu tournament wins without MMA context (too narrow)
- ❌ Coaching certifications (wrong role)

**Evidence Scope Impact**:
- If ranked #3 in Russia for MMA: **RELEVANT**
- If ranked #1 in Russia for boxing: **MARGINALLY RELEVANT** (shows combat sports excellence but not MMA)
- If black belt in jiu-jitsu: **SUPPORTING EVIDENCE ONLY** (component of MMA but not full picture)

---

## Title Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Title

Break down the beneficiary's title into components:

1. **Level Descriptor**: World-class, professional, elite, rising, emerging
2. **Domain**: The field (e.g., tennis, software engineering, classical music)
3. **Role**: Competitor, performer, researcher, creator, coach, executive
4. **Specialization**: Specific niche within domain (e.g., "singles player" vs "doubles specialist")

#### Example: "Elite figure skating coach"

- **Level**: Elite (top-tier, not amateur)
- **Domain**: Figure skating
- **Role**: Coach (not competitor)
- **Specialization**: None specified (all figure skating disciplines)

**Research Impact**:
- ✅ Students' competition results (demonstrates coaching excellence)
- ✅ Coaching certifications and awards
- ✅ Choreography credits
- ❌ Own skating competition history (wrong role - they're a coach now)
- ❌ Ice dancing achievements if they coach singles (wrong specialization)

### Step 2: Identify the Scope Modifier

Determine if the title is:

**EXPANDING** (makes evidence scope larger):
- "Multi-discipline athlete" → Can use achievements from multiple sports
- "Sports and entertainment figure" → Can use athletic AND entertainment achievements
- "Technology innovator" → Can use software, hardware, AI, blockchain achievements

**RESTRICTING** (makes evidence scope smaller):
- "ATP singles player" → Only ATP singles (not doubles, not Challenger tour)
- "Classical violinist" → Only classical (not jazz, not rock)
- "iOS developer" → Only iOS (not Android, not web)

**SPLITTING** (requires evidence in multiple domains):
- "Athlete and entrepreneur" → Need BOTH athletic AND business achievements
- "Researcher and educator" → Need BOTH research publications AND teaching excellence

#### Example Analysis

**Title**: "Professional cricket player"
- **Scope**: RESTRICTING
- **Domain**: Cricket only
- **Evidence Required**:
  - ✅ International cricket statistics
  - ✅ Domestic cricket league performance
  - ✅ Cricket-specific rankings (ICC, domestic leagues)
  - ⚠️ Baseball achievements (different sport - IRRELEVANT)
  - ⚠️ General athletic training posts (too generic - WEAK)

**Title**: "Elite combat sports athlete"
- **Scope**: EXPANDING
- **Domain**: Combat sports (MMA, boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, wrestling)
- **Evidence Allowed**:
  - ✅ MMA rankings and fights
  - ✅ Boxing titles
  - ✅ Kickboxing championships
  - ✅ Wrestling credentials
  - ❌ Tennis achievements (not combat sport)

### Step 3: Map Title to O-1 Criteria

Different titles naturally align with different O-1 criteria:

#### Performer/Competitor Titles → Criteria 1, 2, 3

**Example**: "Professional tennis player"

**Strong Criteria**:
- **Criterion 1**: National/international prizes (tournament wins)
- **Criterion 2**: Membership requiring outstanding achievement (ATP membership)
- **Criterion 3**: Published material about the person (tennis media coverage)

**Weak Criteria**:
- Criterion 4: Judging (unlikely for active player)
- Criterion 5: Original contributions (not research-focused)
- Criterion 6: Scholarly articles (not academic field)

**Research Priority**: Focus Perplexity searches on tournament results, rankings, and media coverage

#### Creator/Researcher Titles → Criteria 5, 6, 7

**Example**: "AI research scientist"

**Strong Criteria**:
- **Criterion 5**: Original contributions of major significance
- **Criterion 6**: Scholarly articles in professional publications
- **Criterion 7**: Employment in critical capacity at distinguished organizations

**Weak Criteria**:
- Criterion 1: Prizes (possible but not primary)
- Criterion 2: Membership (less common in research)
- Criterion 8: High salary (may be strong but harder to prove)

**Research Priority**: Focus on publications, citations, patents, conference presentations

#### Business/Leadership Titles → Criteria 7, 8

**Example**: "Technology startup founder and CEO"

**Strong Criteria**:
- **Criterion 7**: Leading or critical role at distinguished organization
- **Criterion 8**: High salary or other high remuneration

**Weak Criteria**:
- Criterion 6: Scholarly articles (not academic)
- Criterion 1: Prizes (possible but not common for executives)

**Research Priority**: Focus on company valuation, funding rounds, media coverage of the company, salary data

## Title-Driven Research Strategy

### Strategy 1: Competitor/Performer Titles

**Examples**: Athletes, musicians, actors, dancers

**Pre-Research Checklist**:
- [ ] Identify the governing body (ATP, UFC, FIDE, etc.)
- [ ] Determine ranking systems (official rankings, unofficial like Tapology)
- [ ] List major competitions in the field
- [ ] Identify specialized media outlets
- [ ] Note if national team selection is possible

**Perplexity Research Focus**:
1. **Phase 1 - Identity Confirmation**:
   - `"[Name] [sport/domain] official profile"`
   - `"[Name] [governing body] rankings"`

2. **Phase 2 - Criterion-Specific**:
   - **Criterion 1**: `"[Name] championships titles awards [sport]"`
   - **Criterion 2**: `"[Name] national team [sport] selection"`
   - **Criterion 3**: `"[Name] [sport] news media coverage"`

3. **Phase 3 - Source Verification**:
   - Prioritize Tier 1 sources: Official governing bodies, major sports media (ESPN, The Athletic, BBC Sport)
   - Accept Tier 2: Specialized sports media (MMA Fighting for MMA, TennisHead for tennis)
   - Use Tier 3 cautiously: Personal websites, team sites (must verify)
   - Avoid Tier 4: Social media unless massive following (100K+)

**Title-Specific Adjustments**:

| If Title Says... | Then Research Must Include... | And Avoid... |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| "National team member" | Official national team rosters, selection criteria, international competition results | Club/domestic only achievements |
| "Professional [sport]" | Proof of paid competition, not amateur status | Amateur tournament results |
| "Champion" or "titleholder" | Specific championship details, dates, governing body | Informal/self-proclaimed titles |
| "Retired [role]" | Historical achievements during active period | Current rankings (no longer active) |

### Strategy 2: Creator/Researcher Titles

**Examples**: Scientists, engineers, designers, architects, researchers

**Pre-Research Checklist**:
- [ ] Identify primary publication venues (journals, conferences)
- [ ] Determine citation metrics to track (Google Scholar, Web of Science)
- [ ] List major awards in the field
- [ ] Identify peer researchers for comparison
- [ ] Note if patents are relevant in the field

**Perplexity Research Focus**:
1. **Phase 1 - Identity Confirmation**:
   - `"[Name] [field] Google Scholar profile"`
   - `"[Name] [institution] faculty page"`

2. **Phase 2 - Criterion-Specific**:
   - **Criterion 5**: `"[Name] research contributions innovations [field]"`
   - **Criterion 6**: `"[Name] publications [field] author:\"[Last Name]\""`
   - **Criterion 7**: `"[Name] [institution] position role"`

3. **Phase 3 - Source Verification**:
   - Prioritize Tier 1: Peer-reviewed journals, official academic profiles, patent databases
   - Accept Tier 2: Conference proceedings, institutional pages
   - Use Tier 3 cautiously: Personal academic websites, ResearchGate profiles
   - Avoid Tier 4: Non-academic social media

**Title-Specific Adjustments**:

| If Title Says... | Then Research Must Include... | And Avoid... |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| "Principal investigator" | Grant funding as PI, leadership of research projects | Co-author papers where not PI |
| "Published researcher" | Peer-reviewed publications, citation counts | Blog posts, white papers (unless from Tier 1 company) |
| "Patent holder" | USPTO or international patent records | Patent applications (not granted) |
| "Professor" or "faculty" | Academic position verification, teaching records | Adjunct or visiting positions (unless specifically noted) |

### Strategy 3: Business/Leadership Titles

**Examples**: Executives, entrepreneurs, founders, directors

**Pre-Research Checklist**:
- [ ] Identify the company/organization
- [ ] Determine company size, revenue, funding (if startup)
- [ ] List industry publications and rankings
- [ ] Note any public company data (if applicable)
- [ ] Identify comparable companies for benchmarking

**Perplexity Research Focus**:
1. **Phase 1 - Identity Confirmation**:
   - `"[Name] [Company] [Title] LinkedIn"`
   - `"[Name] [Company] leadership team"`

2. **Phase 2 - Criterion-Specific**:
   - **Criterion 7**: `"[Name] [Company] role responsibilities impact"`
   - **Criterion 8**: `"[Company] executive compensation [Title]" OR "[Industry] [Title] salary range"`
   - **Criterion 3**: `"[Name] [Company] news media coverage"`

3. **Phase 3 - Source Verification**:
   - Prioritize Tier 1: Major business media (WSJ, Bloomberg, Forbes), SEC filings
   - Accept Tier 2: Industry trade publications, company press releases
   - Use Tier 3 cautiously: LinkedIn, company website
   - Avoid Tier 4: Personal social media, unverified salary sites

**Title-Specific Adjustments**:

| If Title Says... | Then Research Must Include... | And Avoid... |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| "Founder" or "Co-founder" | Company founding date, role in creation | Joining later as early employee |
| "CEO" or "President" | Ultimate decision-making authority, board reporting | Operational roles without final authority |
| "VP" or "Director" | Department size, budget responsibility, reporting structure | Individual contributor roles |
| "Startup founder" | Funding rounds, valuation, investor names | Pre-revenue side projects |

### Strategy 4: Multi-Domain Titles (Split Focus)

**Examples**: "Athlete and entrepreneur", "Researcher and educator", "Artist and activist"

**CRITICAL**: These titles require evidence in BOTH domains. Strong evidence in one area is insufficient.

**Pre-Research Checklist**:
- [ ] Deconstruct into Domain 1 and Domain 2
- [ ] Determine if the petition emphasizes one domain (80/20) or equal (50/50)
- [ ] Identify evidence requirements for EACH domain independently
- [ ] Plan criterion strategy that spans both domains

**Perplexity Research Focus**:

Must conduct TWO parallel research tracks:

**Track 1: Domain 1**
- Follow the appropriate strategy (Competitor, Creator, or Business) for Domain 1
- Aim for at least 3 strong pieces of evidence

**Track 2: Domain 2**
- Follow the appropriate strategy for Domain 2
- Aim for at least 3 strong pieces of evidence

**Integration**:
- Look for evidence that bridges both domains (e.g., athlete who founded sports tech company)
- Prioritize cross-domain media coverage
- Emphasize how excellence in one domain strengthens the other

**Example**: "Professional athlete and sports entrepreneur"

**Domain 1 Research** (Athlete):
- Athletic rankings and achievements
- Competition results
- Sports media coverage

**Domain 2 Research** (Entrepreneur):
- Company founded/co-founded
- Funding raised
- Business media coverage

**Bridging Evidence**:
- "Former Olympic athlete launches sports tech startup" → Media coverage that mentions BOTH domains
- Athlete endorsement deals → Shows business acumen + athletic credibility
- Speaking engagements about athlete entrepreneurship → Demonstrates expertise in both areas

**Title-Specific Adjustments**:

| If Title Says... | Then You Need... | Minimum Evidence Per Domain |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| "Artist and activist" | Artistic achievements + Social impact campaigns | 3 exhibits/performances + 3 campaigns/movements |
| "Researcher and entrepreneur" | Academic publications + Business ventures | 5 publications + 1 founded company OR 3 publications + 2 companies |
| "Athlete and coach" | Playing achievements + Coaching results | Own competition results + Students' achievements |

---

## Special Title Considerations

### Level Descriptors and Evidence Thresholds

The level descriptor in the title sets the evidence bar:

| Level | Evidence Threshold | Example |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **"World-class"** | Must show top 1-5% globally | #1-20 world ranking, Olympic medalist, Nature publication |
| **"Elite"** | Must show top 10% in field | Top 100 world ranking, national champion, major conference publication |
| **"Professional"** | Must show paid work in field | Proof of income from domain, professional league membership |
| **"Accomplished"** | Must show significant achievements | Regional recognition, peer-reviewed work, industry awards |
| **"Emerging"** | Must show upward trajectory | Rising rankings, growing citations, increasing media attention |
| **"Rising star"** | Must show recent rapid growth | Significant improvement in last 2-3 years, young age + high achievement |

**Research Impact**:

If title says **"world-class athlete"**, then:
- Regional championships are INSUFFICIENT (too low level)
- National championships are MODERATE (shows national standing but not world-class)
- Top 20 world ranking is STRONG (demonstrates world-class status)
- Olympic medal is DEFINITIVE (proves world-class beyond doubt)

If title says **"professional athlete"**, then:
- Proof of paid competition is REQUIRED
- Amateur achievements alone are INSUFFICIENT
- Professional league membership is STRONG
- Contract value or salary data is IDEAL

### Geographic Descriptors

| Geographic Scope | Evidence Requirements |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **"International"** | Must show cross-border impact: competitions in multiple countries, international media, global rankings |
| **"National"** | Must show country-wide recognition: national rankings, national media, national-level competitions |
| **"Regional"** | Limited to specific region: state/province championships, regional media, local rankings |

**Research Adjustment**: An "international tennis player" needs proof of competing outside their home country. A "national champion" needs proof of country-level achievement.

### Temporal Descriptors

| Time Indicator | Research Focus |
|---------------|---------------|
| **"Current"** | Must use recent evidence (last 2-3 years); outdated achievements are weak |
| **"Former"** or **"Retired"** | Focus on peak period achievements; current rankings are irrelevant |
| **"Emerging"** | Must show growth trajectory; static achievements are weak |

---

## Implementation in Automated Research

### Pre-Research Title Analysis Prompt

Before Phase 1 of Perplexity research, the system should analyze:

```
TITLE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST:

1. Beneficiary Title: "[TITLE FROM INPUT]"

2. Title Deconstruction:
   - Level Descriptor: [World-class/Elite/Professional/etc.]
   - Domain: [Field/Sport/Industry]
   - Role: [Competitor/Creator/Leader/etc.]
   - Specialization: [Any niche specified]

3. Scope Determination:
   - Scope Type: [EXPANDING/RESTRICTING/SPLITTING]
   - Evidence Boundaries: [What counts vs. what doesn't]

4. Criterion Alignment:
   - Primary Criteria (title naturally supports): [List 2-3]
   - Secondary Criteria (possible but harder): [List 2-3]
   - Weak Criteria (unlikely for this title): [List 2-3]

5. Research Strategy:
   - Strategy Type: [Competitor/Creator/Business/Multi-Domain]
   - Phase 1 Queries: [Identity confirmation searches]
   - Phase 2 Focus: [Criterion-specific priorities based on title]
   - Source Tier Priorities: [What sources matter most for this domain]

6. Evidence Threshold:
   - Based on level descriptor: [What achievements are "good enough"]
   - Minimum evidence per criterion: [Numbers/metrics]

7. Red Flags to Avoid:
   - [Evidence that seems relevant but doesn't match title]
   - [Sources that are wrong tier for this domain]
```

### Title-Driven Query Modification

**Standard Query** (no title analysis):
```
"Alexander Grozin MMA rankings"
```

**Title-Enhanced Query** (beneficiary is "professional MMA fighter"):
```
"Alexander Grozin professional MMA fighter rankings Tapology Fight Matrix UFC"
```

Why better:
- Includes "professional" to filter out amateur results
- Specifies MMA-specific ranking sources (Tapology, Fight Matrix)
- Adds UFC to find elite-level competition

**Standard Query**:
```
"Dr. Jane Smith publications"
```

**Title-Enhanced Query** (beneficiary is "AI research scientist"):
```
"Dr. Jane Smith AI artificial intelligence research publications Google Scholar author"
```

Why better:
- Specifies "AI" to filter out wrong Jane Smith
- Includes "research publications" to avoid news articles
- Adds "Google Scholar" to find academic profile

### Title-Driven Source Filtering

After Perplexity returns results, filter based on title:

**For "Professional athlete" title**:
- ✅ Keep: Official league sites, major sports media, ranking databases
- ❌ Discard: Amateur competition results, recreational league stats, non-sports content

**For "Research scientist" title**:
- ✅ Keep: Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE, patent databases, university pages
- ❌ Discard: Blog posts, non-peer-reviewed articles, social media

**For "Business executive" title**:
- ✅ Keep: LinkedIn, Bloomberg, Forbes, company press releases, SEC filings
- ❌ Discard: Personal social media, unverified salary sites, job board listings

---

## Examples: Title Analysis in Action

### Example 1: Figure Skater

**Title**: "Elite figure skater and coach"

**Title Analysis**:
- **Level**: Elite (top-tier)
- **Domain**: Figure skating
- **Role**: SPLIT - Both skater AND coach
- **Scope**: SPLITTING (need both skating AND coaching evidence)

**Research Strategy**:

**Track 1: Skating Achievements**
- Search: `"[Name] figure skating competition results ISU"`
- Search: `"[Name] figure skating championships medals"`
- Required: Competition placements, ISU rankings, medals
- Threshold: Top 10 nationally or internationally (due to "elite" descriptor)

**Track 2: Coaching Achievements**
- Search: `"[Name] figure skating coach students results"`
- Search: `"[Name] skating choreography credits"`
- Required: Students' competition results, coaching certifications, choreography credits
- Threshold: Students placing at national/international level

**Evidence Allocation**:
- Must satisfy at least 2 criteria with skating evidence
- Must satisfy at least 1 criterion with coaching evidence
- OR combine: Use Criterion 3 (media) that covers both roles

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Only showing skating achievements (ignores "coach" part of title)
- ❌ Only showing coaching achievements (ignores "skater" part)
- ❌ Showing ice dancing results if they're a singles skater (wrong specialization)

### Example 2: Cricket Player

**Title**: "Professional cricket player representing [Country]"

**Title Analysis**:
- **Level**: Professional (paid competition)
- **Domain**: Cricket
- **Role**: Player (active competitor)
- **Geographic**: International (represents country)
- **Scope**: RESTRICTING (cricket only, not other sports)

**Research Strategy**:

**Phase 1 - Identity Confirmation**:
- Search: `"[Name] cricket [Country] national team"`
- Search: `"[Name] cricket ICC profile"`
- Must find: Official cricket profile, national team selection

**Phase 2 - Criterion-Specific**:
- **Criterion 1**: `"[Name] cricket championships titles awards"`
  - Required: Tournament wins, player of the match awards
- **Criterion 2**: `"[Name] [Country] national cricket team selection"`
  - Required: National team caps, international match appearances
- **Criterion 3**: `"[Name] cricket news ESPN Cricinfo"`
  - Required: Cricket-specific media coverage

**Evidence Threshold**:
- Professional = Must show IPL, Big Bash, or equivalent professional league contract
- International = Must show national team selection and international match stats
- Minimum: 10+ international matches OR 20+ professional league matches

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Club cricket only (not professional level)
- ❌ Baseball statistics (wrong sport)
- ❌ General sports coverage that doesn't mention cricket specifically

### Example 3: MMA Fighter (from Attorney case files)

**Title**: "Professional MMA fighter"

**Title Analysis**:
- **Level**: Professional (paid fights)
- **Domain**: MMA (mixed martial arts)
- **Role**: Fighter (active competitor)
- **Scope**: RESTRICTING (MMA specifically, not just boxing or jiu-jitsu)

**Research Strategy**:

**Phase 1 - Identity Confirmation**:
- Search: `"Alexander Grozin MMA fighter"`
- Search: `"Alexander Grozin Tapology profile"`
- Must find: Fighter record, organization affiliations

**Phase 2 - Criterion-Specific**:
- **Criterion 1**:
  - Search: `"Alexander Grozin MMA championships titles"`
  - Found: Limited championship history
  - Assessment: WEAK for Criterion 1

- **Criterion 2**:
  - Search: `"Alexander Grozin Russia MMA rankings"`
  - Found: #3 in Russia (Tapology), #119 world (Fight Matrix)
  - Assessment: STRONG for Criterion 2 (ranking = membership in top tier)

- **Criterion 3**:
  - Search: `"Alexander Grozin MMA news media"`
  - Found: Limited English-language media
  - Assessment: MODERATE (search Russian-language media)

**Evidence Threshold**:
- Professional = Must show paid fights (not amateur bouts)
- Rankings: Top 10 nationally OR Top 200 globally is strong for O-1
- Minimum: 10+ professional fights with winning record

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Amateur fight record (not professional)
- ❌ Boxing-only achievements (not MMA)
- ❌ Jiu-jitsu tournament wins without MMA context (component skill, not full MMA)

**Attorney Assessment** (from case file):
> "We need more info... just didn't have enough information to get it through. He's good, he's #3 in Russia for MMA which is really good for what he's doing... #119 in the world... if this were cricket that'd be way easier to get through."

**Title-Based Interpretation**:
- Title "professional MMA fighter" requires MMA-specific evidence
- Cricket would be easier because cricket has clearer international infrastructure (ICC rankings, national teams)
- MMA rankings are less standardized (Tapology vs. Fight Matrix vs. UFC rankings)
- Strategy: Focus on Criterion 2 (rankings) since Criterion 1 (championships) is weak

### Example 4: Tennis Player (from Attorney case files)

**Title**: "Professional tennis player"

**Title Analysis**:
- **Level**: Professional (paid competition)
- **Domain**: Tennis
- **Role**: Player (active competitor)
- **Scope**: RESTRICTING (tennis only)

**Research Strategy**:

**Phase 1 - Identity Confirmation**:
- Search: `"[Name] tennis ATP WTA profile"`
- Search: `"[Name] tennis official rankings"`
- Must find: Official ranking history, tournament results

**Phase 2 - Criterion-Specific**:
- **Criterion 2** (PRIMARY for tennis):
  - Search: `"[Name] national tennis team [Country]"`
  - Found: National team selection (per Attorney case file)
  - Assessment: DEFINITIVE - "National team makes it so much easier"

- **Criterion 1**:
  - Search: `"[Name] tennis tournament wins titles"`
  - Required: ATP/WTA tournament victories

- **Criterion 3**:
  - Search: `"[Name] tennis news media coverage"`
  - Required: Tennis-specific media (Tennis.com, ATP/WTA site features)

**Evidence Threshold**:
- Professional = ATP/WTA ranking (not ITF only)
- National team = Automatic strong evidence for Criterion 2
- Minimum: Top 500 ATP/WTA ranking OR national team selection

**Attorney Assessment** (from case file):
> "National team makes it so much easier... if they have national team selection, that's the primary thing we're looking for."

**Title-Based Interpretation**:
- Tennis has clear international structure (ATP/WTA rankings, national teams)
- National team selection is strongest evidence for tennis players
- Research should prioritize finding national team data FIRST
- If no national team: Need higher rankings (Top 200) or significant tournament wins

### Prompt Integration

Add to the beginning of COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY_TRAINING.md instructions:

```markdown
## PRE-RESEARCH REQUIREMENT: Title Analysis

BEFORE conducting any Perplexity searches, you MUST complete a title analysis:

1. Extract the beneficiary's job title/professional descriptor from the user input
2. Deconstruct the title using the BENEFICIARY_TITLE_RESEARCH_GUIDE.md framework
3. Determine evidence scope (EXPANDING/RESTRICTING/SPLITTING)
4. Map title to primary O-1 criteria (which criteria this title naturally supports)
5. Set evidence thresholds based on level descriptor (world-class vs. professional vs. elite)
6. Choose appropriate research strategy (Competitor/Creator/Business/Multi-Domain)

Only after completing this analysis should you proceed to Phase 1 of Perplexity research.

The title analysis will inform:
- Which Perplexity queries to run
- Which sources to prioritize
- Which evidence to keep vs. discard
- Which criteria to emphasize in the petition
```

## Quick Reference: Title → Strategy Mapping

| Title Pattern | Research Strategy | Primary Criteria | Key Sources |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| "Professional [sport] player" | Competitor/Performer | 1, 2, 3 | Governing body, rankings, sports media |
| "Elite [sport] athlete" | Competitor/Performer | 1, 2, 3 | National team, championships, Tier 1 media |
| "Researcher" or "Scientist" | Creator/Researcher | 5, 6, 7 | Google Scholar, publications, patents |
| "CEO" or "Founder" | Business/Leadership | 7, 8, 3 | Bloomberg, Forbes, LinkedIn, funding data |
| "[Role] and [Role]" | Multi-Domain | Varies | Must cover BOTH domains |
| "World-class [anything]" | Any strategy + High threshold | All | Top 1-5% evidence required |
| "National team [sport]" | Competitor | 2 (primary), 1, 3 | National federation, international competitions |

---

## Conclusion

The beneficiary's title is the foundation of the entire research strategy. By analyzing the title BEFORE conducting automated research, you ensure that:

1. **Perplexity queries are targeted** to the right domain and role
2. **Source filtering is appropriate** for the field (athletic vs. academic vs. business)
3. **Evidence thresholds are clear** (what counts as "strong" for this title)
